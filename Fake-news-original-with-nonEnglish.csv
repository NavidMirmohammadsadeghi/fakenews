Bill Nye is heading to Netflix to take down anti-scientific claims,"Bill Nye (Screenshot)

Nye first found television fame in the �۪90s with his weekly children�۪s show on PBS. Now, he�۪s returning to the small screen ��� or, at least, the streaming device ��� with Bill Nye Saves the World, a Netflix series set to debut this spring.

���Each episode will tackle a topic from a scientific point of view,�۝ Nye said in a statement, ���dispelling myths, and refuting anti-scientific claims that may be espoused by politicians, religious leaders, or titans of industry.�۝ Those topics include some hot-button issues, like vaccinations, genetically modified foods, and climate change.





Though he got his start on an uncontroversial kids�۪ show, in recent years Nye has not shied away from contentious issues. He�۪s been an especially outspoken critic of climate change deniers. Last year, he bet notorious denier Marc Marano $20,000 that 2016 would be one of the 10 hottest years on record. Morano declined the offer ��� which, considering the data, was probably wise.

Nye will get some help on his new show from special correspondents like Karlie Kloss. ���We�۪ll be talking about every nerdy thing you can dream of,�۝ says the model.

Primary school allows pupils to wear slippers to improve grades,"A school in Derbyshire is encouraging its pupils to wear slippers in the classroom to help improve their grades.

Findern Primary School, near Derby, is the latest to adopt the Scandinavian attitude of allowing children to take their shoes off inside.

Headteacher Emma Titchener suggested the idea to pupils after reading the results of a study that claimed ���shoeless�۝ children typically showed better behaviour and greater performance in class.

Observing thousands of children from 25 countries of a ten-year period, researchers from the University of Bournemouth found those who left their shoes outside the classroom were more likely to arrive at school earlier, leave later and read more widely.

Trialling the method in one class, teachers at Findern said they saw a significant difference in how students felt and acted in the classroom.

Ms Tichener told the Telegraph: ���It has had a real positive impact; the children are much calmer and more receptive to learning.

���The pupils for more comfortable, they feel more at home and more in tune with the classes.

���The reception among children and teachers has been unanimously positive, and parents are also overwhelmingly supportive of it.

The school�۪s Deputy Headteacher, Michelle Hall, said the policy had since been extended across the school and most children and even some members of staff were now choosing to wear slippers over shoes.

���Our pupils are already very well behaved but there have been some changes,�۝ she said. ���There is less stomping around and the pupils are a lot calmer and seem very relaxed.�۝

The school is believed to be one of the first in the country to introduce the relaxed rules on shoewear, but the approach has long been used by schools in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries where the practice is commonplace.

In order to conduct their study, researchers from the University of Bournemouth visited schools in New Zealand and Australia, as well as a school in London where the habit had been tested.

Experts found that by removing shoes, classrooms were quieter, providing a calmer atmosphere where pupils were more willing to engage in learning activities.

Bullying in schools where the policy had been introduced was also markedly reduced.

In Scandinavia and other northern European countries, children are asked to leave shoes outside the classroom during bad weather, so as not to bring in slush and snow from outside.

However schools in Spain, where it is more common to wear shoes indoors, also tested out the theory and found improved learning and pupil behaviour.

Responding to some criticism of the policy from parents of Findern school pupils, Ms Titchener said: ���Like anything you will always get some opposition to these things, but I think the idea that this makes the children less smartly dressed or less prepared for formal situations is a misconception.�۝

Bournemouth University said it hoped more UK schools would take up the change and see results.

"���UK acting as weapons pimp, reaping rewards of Saudi Arabia�۪s dirty work�۪","We know Riyadh has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there, and they have also attacked the indigenous of Yemen, the Houthis, Raza Kazim, Islamic Human Rights Commission, told RT.

A cross-party group of British MPs have to decide whether to call for the suspension of UK weapons sales to Saudi Arabia or not. The British Prime Minister Theresa May insists sales should continue, and claims the close ties to the country are necessary to keep British people safe.

Her comments came after some British MPs called for the UK to halt its weapons sales to the Middle Eastern nation. Members of the Arms Export Controls committee claim that British weapons might have been used in violations of international humanitarian law.

RT: The Prime Minister's comments have now been backed by the Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson. Yet reports suggest quite the opposite. Why are Britain's decision makers going against the clear findings?

Raza Kazim: I think we need to look at the plethora of evidence that has been gathered. The Committee itself has said that the UK government is probably in violation of its international human rights obligations due to the way that the weapons that have been supplied by the UK have been used. It is said that the assurances supplied by the Saudi government are also not sufficient, not acceptable and so on. Yet, the UK government continues. We need to understand that basically the UK government is acting like a pimp, and is reaping the benefits of the dirty work that Saudi Arabia is actually doing. This needs to stop.

RT: Saudi Arabia is claiming if the UK suspends arms sales, there might be even higher risks of terrorism spreading. Is that a valid point?

RK: There is no evidence to suggest that. Saudi Arabia is the one that is carrying out acts of terrorism. We know that it has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there. We�۪ve seen how Saudi Arabia has attacked Yemen and the indigenous of Yemen, as well, the Houthis, who have been wanting to have self-determination in terms of who is governing them, rather than something that is imposed from Riyadh. We�۪ve seen that various organizations, Save the Children, have come out and said that they are not happy with what has been going on. Hospitals, schools and school teachers, head teachers, etc. have been bombed by Saudi Arabia. We�۪ve seen the facilities of M̩decins Sans Fronti̬res [(MSF) Doctors Without Borders] hospitals being bombed and verified by MSF.

Yet, despite all the evidence that has been gathered in terms of what has been going on, the UK government continues this. We need to be aware that the intelligence offices and people from the UK military establishment are embedded in the command and control center of where these strikes take place. This has been verified in various ways ��� by both Saudi Arabia and the UK. We know that this is going on continuously...

Not easy to resist temptation of easy money

Daoud Khairallah, International Law professor at Georgetown University said that it has not been easy for Britain, the US, or other countries that are providing Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons, ���to resist the temptation of money and corruption.�۝

RT: The Prime Minister's comments have now been backed by the Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson. Yet reports suggest quite the opposite. Why are Britain's decision makers going against the clear findings?

Daoud Khairallah: Well, it has not been easy whether for Britain, or the US, or other countries that are providing Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons. It has not been easy to resist the temptation of money and corruption in this sense. The fact is that we have a threat to the international community, to the whole world by terrorism, and the source of support of these terrorist organizations is well-known now. We know the role that Saudi Arabia is playing.

Add to this, when Saudi Arabia is involved in military operations, such as in Yemen, crimes of war and crimes against humanities have been committed. And the international community has not been sufficiently diligent to investigate and make accountable those responsible for it. Very few journalist and otherwise have the moral courage of speaking out. In the UK apparently some free minds are expressing concerns and rightly so. This is in response to what the whole human race now is concerned about.

RT: Theresa May rejected calls for the UK to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia and stressed the value of close security co-operation with Riyadh. So do you believe the grounds for such a decision are good enough?

DK: The only explanation is the temptation of providing Saudi Arabia with weapons that are richly paid for by the Saudis. It is very difficult to find another explanation, another reasonable explanation. Humanity is not safer with more violence; it is not safer with encouraging extremist groups that are doing all over the Middle East now and expending throughout the world ��� things that are of real concern to the human race and those who still have some moral courage to speak about it.","We know Riyadh has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there, and they have also attacked the indigenous of Yemen, the Houthis, Raza Kazim, Islamic Human Rights Commission, told RT.",[],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,0,12,872,36,1,0,-0.3,0.067535014,0.066666667,0

"���I Actually Want To Be Eaten�۝, Local Cow Hits Back At Vegans","Share 0 SHARES

���There�۪s just something about getting my throat slit, or having a bolt penetrate my frontal lobes that really tingles my udders,�۝ the bovine explains, ���it�۪s the ultimate climax of an uneventful life of eating, shitting and mooing.

Jersey�۪s comments come after a series of vegan demonstrations across the world this week, including Dublin, where an animal rights activist lay naked on a life sized plate of vegetables, with the phrase ���know who you�۪re eating�۪ written on it.

Mr. Musk did not respond publicly to Mr. Zuckerberg. But he posted a brief explanation on Twitter: ���Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.�۝

"Michelle Alexander: White Men Get Rich from Legal Pot, Black Men Stay in Prison","Michelle Alexander: White Men Get Rich from Legal Pot, Black Men Stay in Prison

Ever since Colorado and Washington made the unprecedented move to legalize recreational pot last year, excitement and stories of unfettered success have billowed into the air. Colorado's marijuana tax revenue far exceeded expectations, bringing a whopping $185 million to the state, and tourists are lining up to taste the budding culture (pun intended). Several other states are now looking to follow suit and legalize.

But the ramifications of this momentous shift are left unaddressed. When you flick on the TV to a segment about the flowering pot market in Colorado, you'll find that the faces of the movement are primarily white and male. Meanwhile, many of the more than 210,000 people who were arrested for marijuana possession in Colorado between 1986 and 2010 according to a report from the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, remain behind bars. Thousands of black men and boys still sit in prisons for possession of the very plant that's making those white guys on TV rich.

���In many ways the imagery doesn't sit right,�۝ said Michelle Alexander, associate professor of law at Ohio State University and author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in a public conversation on March 6 with Asha Bandele of the Drug Policy Alliance. ���Here are white men poised to run big marijuana businesses, dreaming of cashing in big���big money, big businesses selling weed���after 40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed, and their families and futures destroyed. Now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?�۝

Alexander said she is ���thrilled�۝ that Colorado and Washington have legalized pot and that Washington D.C. decriminalized possession of small amounts earlier this month. But she said she�۪s noticed ""warning signs"" of a troubling trend emerging in the pot legalization movement: Whites���men in particular���are the face of the movement, and the emerging pot industry. (A recent In These Times article titled ���The Unbearable Whiteness of Marijuana Legalization,�۝ summarize this trend.)

Alexander said for 40 years poor communities of color have experienced the wrath of the war on drugs.

���Black men and boys�۝ have been the target of the war on drugs�۪ racist policies���stopped, frisked and disturbed��Ӊ��often before they�۪re old enough to vote,�۝ she said. Those youths are arrested most often for nonviolent first offenses that would go ignored in middle-class white neighborhoods.

���We arrest these kids at young ages, saddle them with criminal records, throw them in cages, and then release them into a parallel social universe in which the very civil and human rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights movement no longer apply to them for the rest of their lives,�۝ she said. ���They can be discriminated against [when it comes to] employment, housing, access to education, public benefits. They're locked into a permanent second-class status for life. And we�۪ve done this in precisely the communities that were most in need of our support.�۝

As Asha Bandele of DPA pointed out during the conversation, the U.S. has 5% of the world�۪s population and 25% of the world�۪s prisoners. Today, 2.2 million people are in prison or jail and 7.7 million are under the control of the criminal justice system, with African American boys and men���and now women���making up a disproportionate number of those imprisoned.

Alexander�۪s book was published four years ago and spent 75 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, helping to bring mass incarceration to the forefront of the national discussion.

Alexander said over the last four years, as she�۪s been traveling from state to state speaking to audiences from prisons to universities about her book, she�۪s witnessed an ���awakening.�۝ More and more people are talking about mass incarceration, racism and the war on drugs.

Often when people talk about the reasons certain communities are impoverished or lack education they blame the personal choices or moral shortcomings of the people in those communities, but that way of looking at things has got it backwards, she said.

���That these communities are poor and have failing schools and have broken rules is not because of their personal failings but because we�۪ve declared war on them,�۝ she said. ���We�۪ve spent billions of dollars building prisons and allowing schools to fail. We�۪ve decimated these communities by shuttling young people from their underfunded schools to these brand new, high tech prisons. We�۪ve begun targeting children in these communities at young ages.�۝

Alexander cautioned that drug policy activists need to keep this disparity in mind and cultivate a conversation about repairing the damages done by the systemic racism of the war on drugs, before cashing in on legalization.

���After waging a brutal war on poor communities of color, a drug war that has decimated families, spread despair and hopelessness through entire communities, and a war that has fanned the flames of the very violence it was supposedly intended to address and control; after pouring billions of dollars into prisons and allowing schools to fail; we�۪re gonna simply say, we�۪re done now?�۝ Alexander said. ���I think we have to be willing, as we�۪re talking about legalization, to also start talking about reparations for the war on drugs, how to repair the harm caused.�۝

Alexander used the example of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa to point out the way a society can and should own up to its past mistakes. After apartheid ended, the nation passed a law called the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. Under the new law, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed to ""elicit truth"" about the human rights violations that had occurred. The commission recorded the statements of witnesses who endured ""gross human rights violations"" and facilitated public hearings. Those who had committed violence could request amnesty from civil and criminal prosecution in order to share testimony about what they'd done with the commission.

���At the end of apartheid in South Africa there was an understanding that there could be no healing, no progress, no reconciliation without truth,�۝ she said. ���You can�۪t just destroy a people and then say ���It�۪s over, we�۪re stopping now.�۪ You have to be willing to deal with the truth, deal with the history openly and honestly.�۝

Alexander pointed to America�۪s tendency to shove its racist legacies under the rug rather than own up to them. When the civil war ended, slaves were free on paper but they were left with nothing��Ӊ��no 40 acres and a mule, nothing,�۝ Alexander said. The only option was to work low-paying contract jobs for the same slave owners who had previously brutalized them.

���And after a brief period of reconstruction a new caste system was imposed���Jim Crow���and another extraordinary movement arose and brought the old Jim Crow to its knees,�۝ she said. ���Americans said, OK, we�۪ll stop now. We�۪ll take down the whites-only signs, we�۪ll stop doing that. But there were not reparations for slavery, not for Jim Crow, and scarcely an acknowledgement of the harm done except for Martin Luther King Day, one day out of the year. And I feel like, here we go again.�۝

Last week, Obama pushed out an initiative called My Brother�۪s Keeper, focused on helping black boys who have fallen down the social ladder. Alexander said she�۪s glad Obama is shining a spotlight on the crisis facing black communities. However, she said Obama has perpetuated the backward way of framing the situation when he talks about the issues facing those communities.

""I am worried that much of the initiative is more based in rhetoric than in meaningful commitment to address the structures and institutions that have created the conditions in these communities,"" she said.

Asked about the unlikely relationship forming between U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Kentucky�۪s Tea Party senator Rand Paul, both of whom are standing together to end mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders, Alexander responded she is wary of whether these politicians are making the right decisions for the wrong reasons.

She cautioned that politicians across the political spectrum are ���highly motivated�۝ to downsize prisons because the U.S. can no longer afford to maintain a massive prison state without raising taxes ���on the predominantly white middle class.�۝ That shortsighted way of thinking fails to recognize the larger societal patterns that keep the U.S. cycling through various ���caste-like�۝ systems.

���If we're going to downsize these prisons and change marijuana laws and all that, in order to save some cash, but in that process to change these laws, we haven't woken up to the magnitude of the harm that we have done,�۝ she said. ���Ultimately, at least from my perspective, this movement to end mass incarceration and this movement to end the drug war is about breaking our nation�۪s habit of creating caste-like systems in America,�۝ she said. She added that regardless of whether they�۪re struggling with addiction and drug abuse or have a felony on their record, people deserve to be treated with basic human rights.

���How were we able to permanently lock out of mainstream society tens of millions of people, destroy families?�۝ she said. ���If we�۪re not going to have a real conversation about that and ultimately be willing to care for ���them,�۪ the ���others,�۪ those ���ghetto dwellers�۪ who�۪ve been demonized in this rush to declare war, we�۪re going to find ourselves years from now either still having a slightly downsized system of mass incarceration that continues to hum along very well, or we will have managed to downsize our prisons but some new system of racial and social control will have emerged again because we have not yet learned the core lesson that our racial history has been trying to teach us.�۝

"Sean Hannity Slams Megyn Kelly, Says She 'Clearly' Supports Clinton | Breitbart","Fox News host Sean Hannity is lashing out at his colleague Megyn Kelly after she accused Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of avoiding interviews with her. Hannity says she ���clearly�۝ supports Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump.

Hannity, who is open about his support for Trump, was responding to a claim made by Kelly that both Trump and Clinton were avoiding interviews with her because she would put them out of their comfort zone.

���Donald Trump, with all due respect to my friend at 10:00, will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days, which doesn�۪t exactly expand the tent,�۝ Kelly said.

@megynkelly u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u. https://t.co/vsQiNMgHut ��� Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 6, 2016

Hannity responded by saying that Kelly should be mad at Hillary Clinton, and not Trump, adding that Kelly was ���clearly�۝ a supporter of Clinton. He added that Trump has previously done interviews with Kelly.

He was later criticized by a Twitter user who said that Hannity should learn to stand by his colleagues, to which he replied, ���Sure. When they stand by me.�۝

Trump and Kelly have a documented history of conflict, after he previously referred to her as a ���bimbo�۝ and ���lightweight reporter,�۝ after their clash on comments he made about women during a Republican primary debate.

Conservatives declare 'huge win' after IRS impeachment delay,"Conservative House lawmakers said Thursday that they achieved ""a huge win"" in a deal to postpone a floor vote to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and leaders of the House Freedom Caucus worked out a last-minute deal Wednesday to postpone the impeachment vote, which Rep. John Fleming, R-La., had called up on Tuesday. Instead of the vote, the Judiciary panel will hold an impeachment hearing Wednesday where Koskinen will be questioned under oath.

Fleming, a Freedom Caucus member, said Thursday the group would ""still reserve the right"" to bring up an impeachment vote, but said it would come after the November election at the earliest.

""To me, this is a huge win for us because there is more information,"" Fleming said. ""We want to get him under oath and explain why he did what he did. Then we'll have even more information to move forward, if indeed the evidence comes out that he was corrupt and certainly not protective of the important information necessary for this case.""

Republicans have been battling Koskinen for many months over the IRS chief's handling of emails and other data related to the agency's history of targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.

Many GOP lawmakers believe Koskinen withheld information and did not adequately work to preserve critical emails and other data related to the targeting.

""We want to get him under oath and explain to us why he did what he did and why he didn't take custody of the tapes,"" Fleming said, referring to the lost emails, ""why he allowed them to be destroyed, why he lied to Congress about all of this. We want to get him on record.""

But others are nervous about the vote, and the party is known to be split on whether to impeach Koskinen or not. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Thursday he was not involved directly in the deal.

""The members worked the differences out with themselves and the committee of jurisdiction,"" Ryan said. That's how I like getting things handled here. This agreement is a good way of getting things worked out.""

Meanwhile, not all conservatives are satisfied with the deal. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., told reporters Thursday he believed the impeachment vote would move forward next week.

His spokesman has so far not responded to a request for a comment on Huelskamp's claim, which Ryan denied.

""My understanding is in lieu of the vote, they are going to have the hearing,"" Ryan said.

The Tea Party Patriots issued a statement denouncing the deal and called for an impeachment vote before Congress leaves town ahead of the November election.

""Are congressmen really willing to go home and say they sided with the IRS over the American taxpayer?"" spokeswoman Jenny Beth Martin said. ""That they sided with the IRS over their constituents?""","Conservative House lawmakers said Thursday that they achieved ""a huge win"" in a deal to postpone a floor vote to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.",['Graeme Jennings'],http://washex.am,0,0,0.5,1,8,472,25,1,0,0.6,0.219688645,0.6,0

Why you shouldn�۪t work at full capacity,"Have you ever felt like you couldn�۪t take time off work because nobody could do your job while you�۪re away? Do you drop all of your personal plans to work late nights and weekends, and feel guilty simply leaving the office on time?

Work martyrs are drastically changing company culture and leading to a rise in cases of stress and burnout

If any of the above sounds familiar, then you may be one of the growing number of so-called ���work martyrs�۝ who are drastically changing company culture and leading to a rise in cases of stress and burnout.

Binal Patel is the first person to admit he�۪s a work martyr and that he�۪s been suffering from mild burnout by sacrificing all of his free time for his career.

The 25-year old data scientist from Raleigh, North Carolina in the US, says his problems began two years ago when he dove headfirst into a new job at a start-up running analytics for the healthcare industry. There were just 12 employees at the time, and Patel remembers setting the bar a bit too high, working ���12 hours a day at 200%.�۝

The recent university graduate soon realised that taking on masochistic amounts of work was unsustainable

At first, the positive recognition was addicting, but the recent university graduate soon realised that taking on masochistic amounts of work was unsustainable.

���Over time, your company expects you to work at that initial level because that�۪s what you�۪ve done before, and you expect yourself to be at that level because that�۪s what you�۪ve been putting in,�۝ he says. ���But working that hard all the time just isn�۪t feasible.�۝

Patel found himself becoming less productive and efficient the more hours he put in. He says it took an emotional toll, too, ���because you expect yourself to be at a higher level.�۝

Patel is not alone in this predicament. According to a new study from The Workforce Institute at Kronos, 81% of salaried employees in the US report that they work outside of their standard work hours, with 29% doing it three or more days per week. A separate study from the US-based Project: Time Off campaign found that millennials, in particular, are much more likely to become work martyrs than their older peers at a rate of 43%, compared with an average of just 29% across all workers.

Millennials are much more likely to become work martyrs than their older peers at a rate of 43%, compared with an average of just 29%

Experts caution that more time in the office doesn�۪t equate to a better worker, and that bosses need to set clear goals to prevent building potential team burnout into their plans. If not, the repercussions of a stressed-out workforce will become more pronounced as millennials move into management roles and expect the same level of presenteeism from their subordinates.

���What�۪s the future of our work-life balance if this is the mentality we�۪re fostering,�۝ says Katie Denis, lead researcher at Project: Time Off. There needs to be a drastic change in attitude among millennials, ���or we�۪ll see much bigger problems on the horizon.�۝

Studies from Marianna Virtanen of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health have linked overworking with numerous stress-related health problems, including depression, impaired sleep and heavy drinking. Meanwhile, a new study of American, Australian and European workers found that those putting in 55 hours or more per week had a 33% greater risk of stroke and 13% greater risk of coronary heart disease when compared with their peers working a standard 40-hour week.

Fear and uncertainty

The current work martyr trend among 18- to 35-year-olds relates to both healthy ego needs (like striving for a sense of accomplishment) and unhealthy levels of anxiety, says Denis. ���You hear this popular narrative that millennials are entitled and spoiled but what we�۪re finding is that they actually have a lot of fear.�۝

Denis says many millennials entered the workforce at the height of the recession when jobs were scarce. Not only that, they�۪re dealing with an office culture where technology is ubiquitous, yet its boundaries remain unclear with many feeling chained to their devices.

The Project: Time Off report found zero correlation between time spent working and career progression

���There�۪s very little guidance in the workplace about what�۪s appropriate [with technology], so it gives us this feeling that we need to be reachable at all times,�۝ she says. ���This fuels a kind of hyper-intense desire to prove yourself that�۪s playing out really strongly with millennials.�۝

The Project: Time Off report found zero correlation between time spent working and career progression. Quite the contrary, ���people reach a maximum threshold,�۝ Denis explains. ���Even though they may be at the office longer ��� or are working longer hours ��� it doesn�۪t mean they�۪re producing any more than their peers.�۝

A preventable pattern

Ty Tucker, CEO of performance management platform REV, says it�۪s simple to prevent this type of workplace behaviour from occurring in the first place. ���Management needs to define personal employee goals and identify how people are to be judged around performance,�۝ he explains.

Bosses are often the biggest offenders of work martyrdom

A manager should know what could reasonably be accomplished in a 40-hour week in order to prevent burnout and make appropriate choices about budgeting, staffing and measurable objectives, he says. By working off the clock, particularly when starting out, many employees unwittingly make this task harder on their managers.

Tucker believes bosses are often the biggest offenders of work martyrdom. Not only do they set the wrong tone for their employees, but they�۪re ultimately slowing down the business when they make themselves so indispensable to the company that nothing can happen without them.

���When you create these bastions of isolated knowledge you are ultimately going to be less effective as an organisation,�۝ he says.

Martyrs vs heroes

While work martyrs can fall into a toxic trap of long hours and low productivity, Tucker believes there is a healthy alternative: the work hero.

A work hero is usually results driven, not time driven, and may not even be cognisant that he or she is viewed as a hero

���A work hero is someone who can come in, do a great job and save the day when something goes wrong,�۝ Tucker explains. ���This person is usually results driven, not time driven, and may not even be cognisant that he or she is viewed as a hero.�۝

Patel, the data scientist from Raleigh, is now striving toward the latter. He starts a new job in 2017 and says he�۪s going to do the exact opposite of what he did when he entered his current company.

���When I start my new role it won�۪t be about me jumping into everything,�۝ he says. ���I�۪ll still do my job, of course, but I�۪ll make it much more of a team-based effort.�۝

BUSTED: Rudy Giuliani says he never saw Hillary Clinton in NYC after 9/11 ��� but pictures prove he�۪s lying,"Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton

Rudy Giuliani told a bald-faced lie to accuse Hillary Clinton of lying about her response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

The former New York City mayor delivered the whopper Wednesday afternoon while introducing Donald Trump at a rally in Ocala, Florida.





���Don�۪t tell me if you said that you remember Sept. 11, 2001,�۝ Giuliani said. ���I remember Sept. 11, 2001. Yes, yes, you helped to get benefits for the people who were injured that day. But I heard her say that she was there that day. I was there that day, I don�۪t remember seeing Hillary Clinton there. That was like when she said she had to run through gunfire. That turned out to be, what do we call it? A lie.�۝

Giuliani is actually the one lying, because Clinton ��� the Democratic U.S. senator from New York at the time ��� was photographed walking next to him and then Gov. George Pataki about 24 hours after the attacks. According to Think Progress, there is also no record of Clinton claiming to be at Ground Zero on the day of the attack.

State Department-Funded Nonprofit That John Kerry Had ���No Role�۪ In Was Founded In His Home,"A nonprofit created in Secretary of State John Kerry�۪s upscale Boston home and managed by his daughter Vanessa Kerry has received more than $9 million from the Department of State, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation has found.

Seed Global Health was founded at 19 Louisburg Sq in Boston�۪s Beacon Hill, tax forms indicate. News reports show that�۪s Kerry�۪s home address, which Zillow estimates is worth nearly $18 million. Kerry�۪s wife, Teresa, is an heir to the Heinz family fortune.

Beacon Hill is the most expensive block in Boston, with median home values estimated at $6.7 million in 2015, a Boston Globe affiliate reported. The Boston Business Journal ranked Kerry�۪s house the third most valuable home in the city in 2013.

The Department of State has funneled more than $9 million through the Peace Corps to Seed since 2012, TheDCNF previously revealed. The money is awarded under the Global Health Service Partnership (GHSP) ��� a Peace Corps-run and State Department-funded program that Vanessa Kerry created in conjunction with officials from both agencies.

Seed has never been required to compete with other organizations for the funding. It recruits medical volunteers for overseas service.

���As we have made clear, Secretary Kerry played no role in this decision making while in the Senate or subsequently while at the State Department,�۝ Department of State spokesman John Kirby told TheDCNF. ���There was ��� and remains ��� no conflict of interest here.�۝

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton headed the Department of State when Seed formed and received its initial public funding in 2012. John Kerry chaired the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as a democratic senator representing Massachusetts. That panel has oversight of both the Department of State and the Peace Corps.

Seed eventually moved into a Massachusetts General Hospital office ��� Dr. Kerry�۪s primary employer ��� tax forms show. Her father replaced Clinton as secretary of state in February 2013.

The Department of State funded an extension for Seed�۪s contract in 2015, even though the nonprofit couldn�۪t meet the original agreement�۪s terms.

John Kerry announced GHSP�۪s State Department-funded expansion at a December 2014 event, and even bragged about the partnership between the Peace Corps and his daughter�۪s nonprofit.

Neither the Peace Corps nor Seed responded to requests from TheDCNF for comment.

"Transforming the Mundane, Everyday Work of Parenting into A Spiritual Practice","Transforming the Mundane, Everyday Work of Parenting into A Spiritual Practice

This following is an excerpt from the new book Nurture the Wow: Finding Spirituality in the Frustration, Boredom, Tears, Poop, Desperation, Wonder and Radical Amazement of Parenting by Danya Ruttenberg (Flatiron Books 2016)

Jewish law suggests that you should not hold a child during prayer, lest she disturb your concentration, that you should not kiss your children in synagogue, to instill in yourself the idea that no love compares to love of God. If your child is crying, you should indicate���without speaking���to the child to stop crying, and if that doesn't work, you should walk away from her so that her crying does not disturb your prayer. Another source reminds fathers not to hold a diapered child before afternoon prayers, lest he become soiled and miss the start of services. All of this leads one Orthodox rabbi I know to remark that, as a result, he doesn't pray if he's alone with children.

Obviously, traditional Jewish law wasn�۪t written for or by those who are in the trenches of intimate care of small children. There is a not-very-implicit assumption that someone else, somewhere, is in charge of the sticky, huggy, needy, emotional little humans that, evidently, impede a person's ability to live a life of spiritual service. Spirituality and children are placed in opposing, incompatible spheres, and women are relegated, along with the children, away from wherever it is that they're keeping the spirituality.

The idea that caring for children could be a core, crucial, even cornerstone aspect of one's spiritual and religious life, that loving and caring for them should be integrated, somehow, into one's spiritual and religious expression���well, it's totally absent from this thinking. And this absence isn�۪t specific to Judaism. Rather, it's the norm, in a lot of corners of the religious world. For example, a friend who is an Episcopal priest admits that ""most of us Christian parents (at least during liturgy) try to shush our children to keep them from 'disturbing' us or others."" Some churches and synagogues make efforts to be ""family-friendly,"" offering toys in the back corner of the worship space, babysitting, or separate kids' services in a different room. I both applaud these efforts and make ample use of them, myself. But it's true that they continue to perpetuate this notion that grown-up prayer���the ""real"" spiritual life���is something that happens only when the kinder are otherwise occupied. That this kind of intentional spiritual connection cannot happen with children, or as I�۪d like to suggest, through them.

Across cultures, more often than not, men have been the authors of authoritative rulings and women have been at home with children. In some places, women were part of, say, a monastic tradition, but generally not mothering at the same time. The reasons for this are usually socio-economic, but at the end of the day, there are a whole set of experiences, issues, questions, and types of thinking that come out of doing the work of parenting that have not been integrated into classical discussions of prayer and religious practice in general.

I wonder how various religious traditions might have formulated their approaches to prayer (and everything else) if they had been thinking about the realities of parenting small children from the beginning. And I wonder what these traditions could look like if the questions, challenges and types of thinking that parenting opens up were taken seriously and brought into the conversation, even at this late date.

Sure, one could say that there�۪s a tension. On the one hand, when people talk about religious disciplines, the implication is that a person has a practice���prayer, meditation, yoga, and so forth���that gets done every day (or three times a week, or whatever), no matter what, and that the practice Does A Thing; it changes you. On the other, well, what parents know better than anybody, is that theories and principles are great, but when living the messy reality of life, they don�۪t necessarily serve. And more than that, there might be profound truths to be learned from embracing the flux, the flow, as needed, as appropriate. What if there wasn�۪t just one way to do this? What if a lot of ways were the right way?

In my case, I�۪d been carrying around the ultraviolet light, defining my religious expression by traditional rabbinic yardsticks, certain that it was the only possible option. It had served me well for a long time. But once I became a mother, I became more aware of other manifestations of light and discovered that, though sometimes my old means of spiritual practice still served me, there were other possibilities for connecting to the transcendent that, at times, spoke more deeply to who I had become, what I needed now.

Sometimes my prayer��� offered up with intentionality into the great beyond��� involves deep contemplation of my son�۪s ear, or arm. Sometimes it can be found in just being present with him, in snuggles or smiles or games or fielding questions. Sometimes I manifest it in a tiny cry��� ���help!�۝��� barely perceptible even to me, when my kids�۪ needs are too big and overwhelming, when they�۪re acting out, or even just when they�۪re being normally spirited and rambunctious despite the fact that Mommy didn�۪t sleep so well last night. Sometimes prayer involves other things��� singing with them, singing words of liturgy to them, saying words of liturgy to God.

I don�۪t think that how my prayer life has changed signifies that there�۪s no wisdom to the tradition; rather, who I am and what I need has changed. Spiritual practice needs to be wide enough to accommodate expansions and contractions, shifts and changes in how we exist in the world. It has to be big enough for all the love we receive and give out. ���You should not kiss your children in synagogue in order to instill in yourself the idea that no love compares to love of God�۝? Are you kidding me? Th ere is enough room in our spiritual expressions not only for all of the love, but also for the hectic, distracted chaos that so often defines parenting, if we let it���if we are willing to expand our understanding of how much, how many kinds of, light exists in the world.","While the world's religious texts offer wisdom about love, devotion and sacrifice, they have almost nothing to say about handling the day-to-day challenges raising young kids.

The princess Halloween costume has been dethroned - The Boston Globe,"After 11 years at the top, princess costumes have been dethroned as the most popular Halloween costume among children, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation.

This year�۪s most coveted get-up: Superheroes.

������So far it�۪s superheroes across the board: For kids, for adults, for pets,�۪�۪ said Lorenzo Caltagirone, owner of Total Fright, a year-round costume shop in Arlington, Virginia ������The female superhero in particular has really taken off. This is the year of girl power.�۪�۪

Among the biggest sellers so far, Caltagirone says, are Supergirl and Harley Quinn, the DC Comics supervillain.

The shift comes in a year packed with superhero movies, including ������Deadpool,�۪�۪ ������Suicide Squad�۪�۪ and ������X-Men: Apocalypse.�۪�۪ ������Batman and Superman�۪�۪ sparred on the big screen, while Captain American duked it out with Iron Man. But action flicks aren�۪t just dominating the silver screen: The television network CW has four superhero shows in its fall line-up, including ������Supergirl,�۪�۪ ������Arrow�۪�۪ and ������DC�۪s Legends of Tomorrow,�۪�۪ while ������DC Super Hero Girls�۪�۪ has its own video series on YouTube.

������The movie industry has a huge impact on costuming, so that�۪s part of it,�۪�۪ Caltagirone said. ������But then again, who doesn�۪t want to be a superhero? Halloween is the one day of the year you can get away with it.�۪�۪

Halloween spending is expected to reach a record $8.4 billion this year, with Americans spending an average of $82.93 on costumes, decorations and candy, up from last year�۪s $74.34, according to the National Retail Federation.

About one third of all Americans plan to buy costumes this year, accounting for $3.1 billion in spending, according to the survey. About 20 percent of children say they will don a superhero custom (versus 6 percent for princesses), while 9.3 percent of millennials are planning to dress as a Batman character such as Cat Woman, Two-Face and the Joker.

������Every year we have the classics: Batman, Superman, Spiderman,�۪�۪ said Trisha Lombardo, a spokeswoman for the chain Spirit Halloween. ������But this year, we�۪re also seeing a lot of anti-heros, like Harley Quinn, the Joker and Deadpool, who have a mischievous streak.�۪�۪

With the presidential election looming over Halloween, Lombardi says she expects a steady stream of customers who want to dress up as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. At Total Fright, Caltagirone says he has sold out of several rounds of Trump masks, at $24.95 a pop. On Monday, the day of the first presidential debate, he also sold out of Clinton masks. (Indeed, political costumes ranked third on the list of popular options for adults age 35 and over, behind more traditional witch and pirate get-ups.)

Another trend this year: Pet costumes. Roughly 16 percent of Americans say they�۪ll dress up their dogs, cats and bunnies for Halloween, according to the survey. The most popular costumes for pets were pumpkins (1o percent of respondents), followed by hot dogs (8 percent) and bumblebees (5 percent).

������People are spending more and more money on pet costumes,�۪�۪ Caltagirone said, adding that pet items make up about 20 percent of his sales. ������They�۪re a part of the family -- and, well, dogs aren�۪t going to complain about dressing up.�۪�۪",This year�۪s most coveted get-up?

"If Pope Francis were right on adultery, the Catholic Church would collapse","OpinionCatholic Church, Faith, Homosexuality, Marriage

December 7, 2016 (TheCatholicThing) -- If you approve of bank robbery, you won�۪t be able to condemn the act of shoplifting candy bars from a convenience store. I mean, you won�۪t be able to do this if you are to be logically consistent. If you approve of a greater evil, you can�۪t logically condemn lesser evils of the same genus.

Likewise, if you approve of murder you cannot, if you wish to retain your reputation for logical consistency, condemn assault and battery.

Again, if you are a Catholic who approves of adultery, you cannot very well condemn contraception and fornication.

But in the now famous (perhaps I should say notorious?) Chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis seems to approve of what has hitherto been regarded by the Catholic Church as adultery. He asserts ��� or at least he certainly seems to assert ��� that in certain circumstances a divorced-and-remarried Catholic should be allowed to consider his/her second marriage a true marriage. In other words, this divorced and remarried Catholic should be free to have sinless sexual relations with his/her spouse and should be free to receive Communion.

This appears to contradict the plain words of Jesus himself, who said (unless the Gospels misreport him) that a married person who marries again while his/her first spouse is living commits adultery. Pope Francis, then, appears to be condoning in certain circumstances what Jesus himself calls adultery. And if the pope does this, how can he then not also condone (in certain circumstances) contraception and fornication?

In short, doesn�۪t the pope�۪s blessing of adultery in certain circumstances imply the collapse of almost the entire structure of Catholic sexual morality? Apart from rape and child molestation, what sexual taboos would remain? And won�۪t the priest or ex-priest who molested boys be able to argue that that kind of thing is allowable ���in certain circumstances�۝?

As for homosexual sodomy, the question of whether or not to condemn it would depend on whether it is more or less of a sin than adultery. If less, then the pope�۪s permission of adultery in certain circumstances would also apply to homosexual behavior in certain circumstances. If more, then I suppose Catholics could still condemn homosexual conduct. But in reality, how could they do this if the whole structure of Catholic sexual morality had collapsed? If adultery and fornication deserve approval, who except a genuine homophobe would have the heart to disapprove of homosexual sodomy?

You could still condemn abortion. For abortion, being homicide, is a worse sin than adultery. In the real world, however, everybody who approves of sexual freedom also approves of adultery. Catholics, beginning with popes and bishops, could still condemn abortion, but their hearts wouldn�۪t be in it. De facto, they would approve of it.

A defender of Chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia might respond to what I have just said by pointing out that the pope is urging us to tolerate second marriages only in very rare and very narrow circumstances. He does not intend to open the door to the current secular ideal of nearly limitless sexual freedom. True enough. Likewise, the people who didn�۪t repair the leak in the dike didn�۪t intend to have the dike collapse and the land behind the dike flooded by seawater. After all, it was such a big dike and such a small leak. What harm could be done?

Human beings, and I include Catholics in that category, are rational animals. This doesn�۪t mean we are infallible; it doesn�۪t even mean that we are very smart. But we tend to be consistent, at least in the long run. Once we adopt the principle, for instance, that ���all men are created equal,�۝ it will sooner or later dawn on us that we�۪ll have to get rid of slavery. Likewise, once Catholics agree with the pope that Jesus was in error when he expressed his absolutist views about the indissolubility of marriage, the whole structure of Catholic sexual morality will sooner or later collapse.

And not just sexual morality. The whole structure of Catholicism will collapse. For if Jesus, who (we should remember) was no minor authority figure in the history of the Church, was wrong about marriage, who knows how many other things he was wrong about? And if Jesus was wrong, it is likely St. Paul and other New Testament writers were wrong. And if Jesus and Paul were wrong, who can be confident in the teachings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church? One small leak in the dike.

Now I don�۪t write all this as an ultra-conservative. Not at all. If I were able to write the Church�۪s law regarding marriage and sex, I�۪d allow everybody at least one divorce; for good people often make big mistakes, especially when young. And I�۪d have a tolerant attitude toward fornication and unmarried cohabitation, and I�۪d be only mildly censorious toward an occasional adultery. And if, nearly 2,000 years ago, Jesus had asked my advice, I would have recommended that he adopt my views, inspired as they are by the great moral wisdom of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

For better or worse, however, the Catholic Church is not founded on the wisdom of the very enlightened and progressive present day. It is founded instead on what seems to a truly modern mind to be the provincial ���wisdom�۝ of an itinerant Palestinian preacher of the first century ��� a preacher we Catholics believe to be the all-perfect God incarnate. At least we say we believe this. If we really believe it, and if a disagreement opens up between Jesus and the pope on the question of the indissolubility of marriage, then, much though it grieves us to separate ourselves from such a good man as Pope Francis, we have no choice but to take the side of Jesus in this dispute.

If we don�۪t, the dike will collapse.

Idaho Planned Parenthood Suing Pro-Life Pregnancy Center Neighbors for Providing Healthcare,"Planned Parenthood (PP) has always been a controversial organization and a main target of the pro-life movement. While PP maintains they are vital for women�۪s healthcare provision in this country, pro-life organizations regularly refute that assertion, saying that the country�۪s largest abortion provider doesn�۪t provide much care at all; it is certainly not a healthy place for a baby in the womb.

The fight to publicly defund PP�۪s abortion mills rages on, but PP also engages in strong-arm tactics and harassment in efforts to shut down alternative forms of women�۪s and pregnancy healthcare.

No one knows this better than Brandi Swindell, founder and director of the Stanton Healthcare Center in Boise, Idaho. Swindell is well known in the pro-life movement and established her non-profit, free pregnancy and healthcare center after an experience with a friend who had an abortion changed her heart forever. She saw the pain and emotional despair in the aftermath and knew there had to be a better way to help frightened women in desperate situations.

After years of networking and fundraising, Swindell has been able to purchase outright a building to house Stanton services. Those building just so happen to be the direct neighbors of a Planned Parenthood. From the beginning the abortion provider was none too pleased to see the pregnancy center open right next door. They immediately began making petty complaints, even calling police when Swindell sent her assistant to take pictures of surrounding business�۪s banners as to make sure their own met the size requirements. Their complaint? The assistant stepped on their grass.

The police took one look at the slight, meek 22-year-old employee and told the Stanton staff to have a nice day.

Over the years Stanton�۪s PP neighbors have eased up on their complaints. Swindell is extremely careful to meet all of the requirements of the state and her business complex. When Stanton began a mobile healthcare clinic which sometimes parks in the commons area of the complex, it seemed a bridge too far. Last week Planned Parenthood slapped Stanton with a lawsuit alleging misuse and abuse of the common areas and claiming that the clinic invites people to use the common area to protest and cause nuisances.







Swindell says her attorneys are currently reviewing the rules but are confident PP does not have appropriate grounds for the law suit.

They�۪re saying that we�۪re inviting other groups to our property and they�۪re blaming us for any nuisances brought by groups. We have very strict policies of code of conduct. Our brand is getting bigger and bigger and women are responding.

That, claims Swindell, is really what PP finds the most threatening.

While PP simply hands out referrals for many vital healthcare services like mammograms and health screenings, the Stanton mobile clinic provides a full array of medical services, free of charge. The 35 ft. state-of-the-art RV includes an exam room, ultrasound equipment, baby supplies, maternity clothes, prenatal vitamins and a host of other medical necessitities for women who are left out of the healthcare system.

For now the clinic remains local to the center, but once the proper provisions are in place (which Swindell says should be in a short time) the clinic plans to bring their services directly to the homeless community in Boise. They will provide feminine hygiene products and healthcare to homeless women and will continue their support for the refugee community in ID as well. They also aim to travel to high schools and underserved rural areas across the state.

But that�۪s not all Stanton plans to do. After recently closing on their second building Swindell says they have plans to build a ���mega-clinic�۝ to provide the highest possible quality of life-affirming women�۪s healthcare. This ��� she maintains- is the real reason PP suddenly brought suit. The abortion giant feels threatened. Swindell finds it all very ironic.

Planned Parenthood is always fighting for access issues; they�۪re always accusing the pro-life community of trying to block access and here they are trying to block access!

For Stanton�۪s part, the healthcare provider claims the only complaints they have ever received from the community in their business complex have come from Planned Parenthood, and in fact they have been welcomed openly as their services have driven up the value of the property.

They support us. They like us there because we bring some calmness and peace. When Planned Parenthood comes in property value goes down and most businesses don�۪t like it. We don�۪t like abortion clinics because they kill children but they�۪re not even wanted by the business community.

Swindell maintains that Stanton�۪s only goal is to provide quality care for women in need. She wants Stanton to directly compete with PP as an alternative that affirms life instead of takes lives. Stanton�۪s only tactics are to be visible and accessible. Nothing more.

���Whether people are pro-life or prochoice they need to know that Planned Parenthood thinks they have the authority to prevent us from helping women. They�۪re trying to prevent us from doing good. That�۪s disgusting.�۝

Stanton has set up a GoFundMe page for those who might like to donate in support of their legal defense. There is also information about resources and support opportunities on their website.","While complaining about pro-lifers denying healthcare access, the abortion giant seeks to deny healthcare access","['Kira Davis', 'Posted At Pm On December', 'Brandon Morse', 'Jennifer Van Laar', 'Alex Parker', 'Amelia Hamilton', 'T Laduke']",http://bit.ly,0,0,0.5,7,11,869,15,0,0,-0.1,0.09168254,0,0

Colin Kaepernick's Practice Socks Depict Cops As Pigs,"San Francisco 49ers backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick was photographed at a team practice last month wearing anti-law enforcement socks that portray police officers as pigs.

The 28-year-old multi-millionaire quarterback grabbed headlines last week after he vowed to protest the national anthem by remaining seated at football games.

After a week of standing by his decision to publicly dishonor the country�۪s national anthem and flag, a photograph taken on Aug. 10 reveals Kaepernick�۪s new-found social activism may have taken on an more aggressive, anti-law enforcement tone than previously thought.

It is unclear if the quarterback has worn the socks since the photo was taken.

Kaepernick, who also recently wore a T-shirt praising Cuban communist dictator Fidel Castro and a Malcolm X hat during a press conference, told ESPN that he is boycotting the national anthem because of alleged police brutality against minorities.

���People of color have been targeted by police,�۝ he said, wearing a Castro shirt emblazoned with the words ���Like Minds Think Alike.�۝

���So that�۪s a large part of it and they�۪re government officials,�۝ he said. ���You have people that practice law and are lawyers and go to school for eight years, but you can become a cop in six months and don�۪t have to have the same amount of training as a cosmetologist.�۝

Kaepernick, who is half black, was spotted sitting down during the singing of ���The Star-Spangled Banner�۝ prior to last Friday�۪s preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. He told reporters after the game he would no longer stand up to honor a country that ���oppresses�۝ minorities.

���I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,�۝ he said.

The 6��_ 4��_ signal-caller, who is endorsed by Apple-owned Beats Electronics and Electronic Arts, sat down for the anthem for the team�۪s previous exhibition games this season, and also plans to do so for the team�۪s Thursday night game against the San Diego Chargers for Military Night ��� where he will be surrounded by thousands of American flags and other patriotic symbols.

Military night will pay tribute to ���hundreds of thousands of current and retired military personnel who live and work in San Diego,�۝ according to the team�۪s website.

Despite the large amount of veterans and law enforcement expected to be in attendance for the game, Kaepernick says his protest of the the American flag will continue.

���When there�۪s significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it�۪s supposed to represent in this country, I�۪ll stand,�۝ Kaepernick said.

The quarterback has not publicly commented on his decision to wear anti-police socks during practice last month.

DOJ Warns Landlords About Conducting Criminal Background Checks on Would-Be Renters,"The U.S. Justice Department is making it harder for landlords to exclude ex-convicts. (AP File Photo)

(CNSNews.com) - As President Obama commutes the sentences of more and more prisoners, his Justice Department intends to make it harder for landlords to deny affordable housing to ex-convicts.



The Justice Department announced on Tuesday that it is involving itself in a legal case in New York brought by a group that helps ""formerly incarcerated individuals"" find housing.



The group complained that a 917-unit complex in Far Rockaway, Queens (N.Y.) had a policy of refusing to rent to individuals with prior convictions for felonies or misdemeanors other than traffic offenses. The plaintiff argues that this policy has an unjustified disparate impact against prospective African-American and Hispanic tenants, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.



Although the Fair Housing Act does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants�۪ criminal records, the DOJ says ���categorical prohibitions that do not consider when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then run a substantial risk of having a disparate impact based on race or national origin.�۝



In other words, if landlords have policies banning ex-convicts in general, they could be in trouble if too many of those ex-cons happen to be black or ethnic minorities. It's called ""disparate impact.""



���This filing demonstrates the Justice Department�۪s steadfast commitment to removing discriminatory barriers that prevent formerly incarcerated individuals from restarting their lives,�۝ said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department�۪s Civil Rights Division.



���Women and men who served their time and paid their debt to society need a place to live, yet unlawful housing policies can too often prevent successful reentry to their communities. While not all criminal records policies adopted by landlords violate the Fair Housing Act, we will take action when they do.""

U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern District of New York said, ""Landlords' categorical refusals to rent to individuals who have served their debts to society can illegally discriminate against those individuals based on their race or national origin.""



There is a growing need for affordable housing for ex-convicts as President Obama frees so many of them.



According to the White House, President Obama has commuted the sentences of 774 inmates, more than the previous 11 presidents combined. With a total of 590 commutations this year, President Obama has now commuted the sentences of more individuals in one year than in any other single year in our nation�۪s history.

The Justice Department says when a housing provider's background-check policy is found to have a disparate impact, the housing provider must ���prove with evidence -- and not just by invoking generalized concerns about safety -- that the ban is necessary.�۝



Even then, the policy will still violate the Fair Housing Act if there is a less discriminatory alternative.



The Justice Department intends to ""assist the court"" in determining whether criminal background checks produce unlawful discriminatory effects.","Although the Fair Housing Act does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants�۪ criminal records, the DOJ says ���categorical prohibitions that do not consider when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then run a substantial risk of having a disparate impact based on race or national origin.""",['Susan Jones'],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,1,11,495,57,1,0,-0.4,0.100301484,0.15,0

California adopts first U.S. energy-saving rules for computers,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California regulators on Wednesday adopted the nation�۪s first mandatory energy efficiency rules for computers and monitors - devices that account for 3 percent of home electric bills and 7 percent of commercial power costs in the state.

Apple's new MacBooks are displayed following an Apple event in San Francisco, California March 9, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo

The state Energy Commission said that when fully implemented the industry-backed plan will save consumers $373 million a year and conserve at least as much electricity annually as it takes to power all of San Francisco�۪s households.

Final approval at a meeting of the five-member commission in Sacramento capped several years spent developing the rules in collaboration with computer makers, consumer activists, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and other environmental groups.

The new rules will cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion to generate power by 700,000 tons a year, the NRDC said.

The standards work by setting benchmarks for machines�۪ overall energy use - focusing on when they are turned on but left inactive - and leave manufacturers flexibility to choose which efficiency measures are employed to meet the standards, an approach aimed at fostering innovation.

The rules drew support from nearly 40 companies represented by the Information Technology Industry Council, including such Silicon Valley giants as HP Inc and Intel Corp.

HP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford called the standards ���groundbreaking,�۝ describing them as ���ambitious but achievable.�۝

���This is a big deal,�۝ said Mark Cooper, a policy analyst for the Consumer Federation of America, adding that computer ownership per capita in California ranks second in the world behind Sweden.

In California, computers and monitors draw an estimated 5,610 gigawatt-hours of energy per year - representing roughly 3 percent of residential electric bills and 7 percent of power costs for commercial users - much of that while the devices sit idle.

The NRDC has said the amount of power consumed by computers and monitors will be reduced by a third once there is a complete turnover in existing stocks of those devices.

The first phase of the rules takes effect in January 2019 for desktop, laptop and notebook computers. The standards kick in for workstations and small-scale servers in January 2018 and for computer monitors in July 2019.

Video-game consoles, industrial computers, large-scale servers, tablets and other handheld devices are exempt.

The standards will add about $14 to average retail costs of desktops, which are far less energy efficient than laptops, but will save consumers more than $40 in electric bills over five years, according to commission estimates.

Over half of desktops typically in use in California now meet the first tier of the standards, which grow more stringent in 2021. Seventy-three percent of laptops already comply.

Computer monitors have farther to go, with a compliance rate of just 14 percent among the 25 million units now installed in homes and businesses statewide.

The latest rules could set a new standard for manufacturers everywhere by virtue of the size of the consumer market in California, which often leads the way in U.S. environmental initiatives.

If the same standards are adopted nationwide, they could save U.S. consumers about $2.2 billion annually in electric bills while reducing energy generation by the equivalent output of seven coal-fired power plants, the NRDC said.

Opinion | The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes,"���The tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,�۝ Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. ���All these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.�۝

The inequities contribute to the great American stagnation that I described in last week�۪s column. The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by G.E., Coca-Cola and others is money that can�۪t be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can�۪t be used to reduce their taxes and can�۪t pay for schools, medical research or clean energy.

There is another victim, too ��� one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can�۪t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.

Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren�۪t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven�۪t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can�۪t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon�۪s rate.

This system is cumbersome ��� causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance ��� and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors�۪ money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.

Fortunately, there are signs of hope. Overhauling the corporate tax code is a rare issue on which the two parties have some common ground. If the Democrats take the Senate, Wyden is in line to lead the Finance Committee and says its first priority will be a big bill to improve roads, bridges and public transit systems (and create jobs). The second will be a corporate-tax bill to pay for the infrastructure. Both are good ideas.","It�۪s time to stop companies ��� like Amazon, Boeing and Coca-Cola ��� from damaging the economy by legally shirking taxes.",[],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,0,8,318,20,0,0,0,0.204453024,0.2,0
Russians�۪ attitude to United States shows improvement,"In recent months the average Russian has begun to think more favorably about the United States, with over half the participants in the latest polls saying they expect President-elect Donald Trump to further improve relations between the two nations.

According to a report by Russia�۪s Levada independent public opinion center, the share of Russians who describe their attitude to the USA as ���good�۪ is now at 28 percent. In September, this proportion was 23 percent, and in May it was 19 percent.



Still, 56 percent of respondents told researchers that their attitude to the United States was ���bad�۪, compared to 64 and 70 percent in September and May this year respectively.

However, 54 percent also said they expected Russia-US relations to improve during Trump�۪s presidency. Only 2 percent said relations would further deteriorate and 27 percent said they expected no major changes.

Seventy-eight percent of respondents hold that the Americans�۪ choice of president also affects the lives of Russians, while 16 percent think this is not the case.

In February last year, the negative attitude towards the US and EU among the Russian public was the highest in modern history, with 36 percent wanting their country to further distance itself from the West. The number of Russians who claimed their negative attitude to the United States was at 81 percent and the number of those who perceived the relations between the two nations as hostile was at 42 percent.

Back then, 40 percent of Russian citizens said they wanted the authorities to improve the relations with Western nations, but 36 percent maintained that Russia must further distance itself from the West.","In recent months the average Russian has begun to think more favorably about the United States, with over half the participants in the latest polls saying they expect President-elect Donald Trump to further improve relations between the two nations.",[],https://www.rt.com,0,0,1,0,7,273,39,0,0,0,0.015069444,0.097619048,0

'CELEBRITY IDIOT:' Twitter conservatives rage after Kelly Clarkson calls Hillary Clinton a 'badass',"Bill Clinton photobombs Kelly Clarkson (Screenshot/Twitter)

Country music phenom Kelly Clarkson expressed support for Hillary Clinton�۪s presidential candidacy this week, prompting a backlash from conservative fans.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, a reporter asked Clarkson, ���Speaking of presidents, the election is starting to get in gear. Do you like any of the candidates?�۝ The pop star replied, ���I�۪m a fan of Hillary. She�۪s badass. I don�۪t just want a woman to win, I want the right person. And I think she�۪s also that.�۝





Team Clinton, reacting to Clarkson�۪s compliments, tweeted their own affirmation of the American Idol alum on Thursday:

Back at you, @kelly_clarkson. via @rollingstone pic.twitter.com/SWMU3WTbGG ��� Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 21, 2015

Bustle points out Clinton has been a fan of Kelly Clarkson�۪s at least as far back as 2012, when the then Secretary of State emailed her deputies the following statement of encouragement before they testified at a congressional hearing: ���Well, what doesn�۪t kill you, makes you stronger (as I have rationalized for years), so just survive and you�۪ll have triumphed!�۝

���Stronger (Doesn�۪t Kill You)�۝ was a Friedrich Nietzsche-inspired pop hit Clarkson took to the top of the billboard charts in 2011.

Meanwhile, conservatives on Twitter have their own opinions about Clarkson�۪s stated support for Hillary Clinton. What follows is a sampling of recent reactions to Clarkson�۪s political comments in Rolling Stone:

Experts Concerned Megaquake Will Soon Strike the Nation as Blood Saturates Entire Islamic Town! (Video) | Prophecy,"Experts Concerned Megaquake Will Soon Strike the Nation as Blood Saturates Entire Islamic Town! (Video)

Did you know that Oklahoma was just hit by the largest earthquake ever recorded in the history of the state? And did you know that Oklahoma absolutely shattered their yearly record for earthquakes in 2015 and may break it again this year?

According to the USGS, the number of significant earthquakes in the eastern and central sections of the nation has more than quintupled in recent years, and concern is growing that we could soon see a ���megaquake�۝ in the middle part of the country. Of course no discussion of megaquakes in the middle part of the country can leave out the New Madrid fault zone, which is approximately six times larger than the San Andreas fault zone in California. Scientists assure us that the New Madrid fault is around 30 years overdue for a major seismic event, and when it does happen it is going to be the biggest disaster in modern American history up to this point. Late last month, eight states took part in a major drill that simulated what the damage from a New Madrid earthquake might look like. ���Prophecy News Watch

Concerns Grow About Coming New Madrid Megaquake As Blood Saturates Entire Town

The following comes from a news report that was posted on August 24th:

Eight states are taking part in a multi-state disaster drill Wednesday. Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas all took part in the ���Show Me Mass Care Exercise�۝ to practice how they would react during a major earthquake along the new Madrid Fault Line, which is a major source of earthquakes in the Midwest and south.

The New Madrid fault zone is approximately six times larger than the San Andreas fault zone. But because of the nature of the earth�۪s crust in the region, a New Madrid earthquake would shake most of the nation. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources stated that earthquakes along the New Madrid fault ���shake and damage an area approximately 20 times larger than earthquakes in California�۝.

Thus, the New Madrid fault zone has respecfully earned the name ���sleeping giant�۪.

Back in 1811 and 1812, a series of earthquakes along the New Madrid so powerful occurred that they actually cracked sidewalks all the way in Washington D.C. while ringing church bells in Boston. In fact, reports from eyewitnesses sounds like something straight out of a science fiction movie!

In fact, 8-years-old at the time, Godfrey Lesieur said that he witnessed the ground ���rolling in waves.�۝ While another witness, Michael Braunm, observed the river suddenly rise up ���like a great loaf of bread to the height of many feet.�۝ And, sections of riverbed beneath the Mississippi rose so high that a portion of the river ran backwards.

���Thousands of fissures ripped open fields, and geysers burst from the earth, spewing sand, water, mud and coal high into the air. In those days not many people lived in the middle of the country. What in the world would such an earthquake look like today?�۝ PNW News

With all of our technology today that we are so dependent upon, what would happen if an earthquake even close to this magnitude struck on the New Madrid fault line?

"For your retirement planning, count on living until age 95","CLOSE According to a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 65.4% of American families with heads of household 55 and older held debt in 2013. USA TODAY

Planning for how long your nest egg needs to last is a difficult one. (Photo: Thinkstock)

If you knew your date of death, retirement planning would be a breeze.

Unfortunately ��� or maybe fortunately? ��� you don't. And that can make planning for retirement extremely difficult. Does your nest egg need to last 20 years? 30 years? 40 years? And what about couples? How should couples go about planning for the likelihood that one spouse ��� usually the husband ��� predeceases the other?

Well, if you�۪re like most people, you�۪re guessing at this, and guessing quite wrong.

���Many people do not understand longevity well, and those people who plan often do not plan for long enough,�۝ says Anna Rappaport, president of a retirement consulting firm bearing her name and chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks.

Noel Abkemeier is the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force. (Photo: Handout)

Becoming familiar with current life-expectancy statistics is the first order of business. ���There are two aspects to addressing longevity,�۝ says Noel Abkemeier, the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force. ���First, understanding it, and then planning an income that will last throughout life.�۝

You may live much longer than you think. ""There have been significant improvements in how long people survive in retirement, especially for wealthier Americans,�۝ says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management.

Consider: Someone born in 1950 was expected to live to age 68.2. By contrast, someone born in 2014 was expected to live to age 78.8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In other words, someone born today will need to fund an extra 10 years of retirement vs. someone born 66 years ago.

What�۪s more, life expectancy for those alive at age 65 has also increased dramatically. In 1950, a 65-year-old male could expect to live another 12.8 years. In 2014, a 65-year-old male could expect to live on average of 18 more years. The same is true for women. In 1950, a 65-year-o woman could expect to live another 15 years. By 2014, a 65-year-old woman could expect to live another 20.5 years.

The Actuaries Longevity Illustrator can give you a good sense of how long you might live. Another resource is the Living to 100 life expectancy calculator.

Financial advisers are starting to change assumptions about how long clients will live to make sure they don't outlive savings, according to a survey by InvestmentNews. Advisers are basing retirement-income plans on an average life span of 91 for men and 94 for women, according to the survey.

���Many people do not understand longevity well,�۝ says Anna Rappaport, chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks. (Photo: Anna Rappaport Consulting)

Consider the probabilities. One drawback with using life expectancy to plan for retirement is that it�۪s just an average. One-half will die before life expectancy, and the other half after. So, the better way to approach the problem is to consider the probability of living to certain ages.

Consider: There�۪s a 25% chance that a 65-year-old man will live to 93; a 25% chance that a 65-year-old woman will live to 96; and for a couple 65 years old, there�۪s a 25% chance that the surviving spouse lives to 98, according to SOA projections.

All that said, Blanchett still thinks it makes more sense for people (and planners) to use a fixed time horizon, such as planning to age 95.

Couples should consider their combined planning timeline. For couples who are 65 today, there�۪s a 45% chance that a wife outlives her husband by five years and a 20% chance by 15 years, according to the SOA. ���Don�۪t forget that assets need to last until the second to die for couples,�۝ says Rappaport.

Consider your genes and behavior. ���Some factors that influence how long you live may be beyond your control,�۝ according to the SOA. ���Others depend upon the choices you make every day. A successful retirement plan will address both.�۝

How will you manage longevity risk? There are some time-honored ways to deal with the risk of outliving your assets. Those include the use of annuities, a sound asset-drawdown plan, delaying Social Security to age 70 for the higher wage earner, and a reverse mortgage. Read Managing Post-Retirement Risks - A Guide to Retirement Planning.

Remember, says Abkemeier, half of retirees will live longer (than life expectancy) and, to build in a cushion, individuals should plan for an additional five or more years when considering lifetime income.

Siapakah Alicia Machado yang mengaku diolok 'Miss Piggy' oleh Trump?,"Hak atas foto AP Image caption Alicia Machado terpilih sebagai Miss Universe pada 1996 dan mengklaim diolok oleh Trump.

Seorang mantan Miss Universe menjadi topik dalam debat pertama calon presiden Amerika Serikat dari Partai Republik Donald Trump dan Partai Demokrat Hillary Clinton.

Dalam debat pertama calon presiden Amerika Serikat ini, Clinton menuduh Trump memperlakukan perempuan dengan sangat buruk termasuk klaim bahwa ia pernah menghina Alicia Machado dengan menyebutnya ""Miss Piggy"" (Nona Babi) setelah berat badannya naik menyusul kontes ratu kecantikan itu.

Clinton juga mengatakan Trump pernah menyebut Miss Universe 1996 yang lahir di Venezuela itu sebagai ""Miss Housekeeping"" (Nona Rumah Tangga).

Trump yang saat itu termasuk pemilik perusahaan yang menyelenggarakan Miss Universe juga dilaporkan menyebutnya ""mesin makan"".

Machado muncul dalam video kampanye Clinton setelah debat Senin (26/09).

Debat pertama calon presiden Amerika Serikat ini dikicaukan sekitar lima juta kali dan 62% di antaranya tentang Trump.

Image caption ""Terima kasih Hillary Clinton telah menyebut saya dalam debat.""

Machado melakukan diet pada 1997 setelah mengatakan ia bertambah berat badannya. Trump mengatakan dalam satu acara bahwa ""ia suka makan, seperti kita semua"" dan mendukung upaya dietnya dengan meminta Machado melakukan senam di depan pers.

Di sela tiap menit

Dalam debat yang berlangsung panas, Clinton menegur Trump yang tidak menyebut nama mantan ratu kecantikan ini dengan mengatakan, ""Donald, dia punya nama. Namanya Alicia Machado dan dia telah menjadi warga negara Amerika Serikat, dan dia akan ikut memilih pada bulan November ini,"" kata Clinton.

Image caption Machado mengatakan secara terbuka ia akan memilih Clinton dalam pemilihan presiden.

Trump meminta rincian lebih lanjut tentang tuduhan itu namun tidak segera menyanggahnya.

Melalui akun Twitternya, Machado menyatakan ""Terima kasih kepada Clinton karena telah menyebut saya dalam debat.""

Ia juga menulis, ""Saya telah menerima paspor saya! Saya siap untuk memilih bagi negara saya, untuk Anda @HillaryClinton, untuk putri saya, untuk pekerja perempuan.""

Dalam debat pertama ini, cara Trump menghadapi saingan perempuannya ini juga banyak dikomentari, terutama terkait berapa kali ia melakukan interupsi.

Trump pertama kali menginterupsi Clinton dan melakukannya hampir tiap menit dalam 25 menit pertama, menurut data oleh Vox.

""Salah, salah, salah,"" kata Trump dalam salah satu tanggapan dan dalam satu kesempatan sempat menceletuk ""tidak.""

Image caption ""Clinton menghadapi interupsi setiap .0007 detik dengan sangat bagus. Perempuan tampaknya terbiasa, laki-laki mencoba menyalip.

Secara total, Vox mengatakan Clinton menginterupsi 17 kali sementara Trump 51 kali.

""Seorang calon pria tak boleh terlihat menakut-nakuti seorang perempuan,"" kata Jennifer Lawless, profesor pada Schoold of Public Affairs, American University.

Traister was an indispensable voice during the 2016 election, writing about Hillary Clinton with warmth, lucidity, and insight. All three qualities are on display in her extraordinarily researched, cogently argued investigation into the rise of the single woman, which examines how unmarried women have long spearheaded social change and tracks the uneven line from past progressive movements to our current feminist flourishing. (I only wish she could have included a post-Trump addendum.) Especially notable is Traister�۪s attention to the full racial and economic spectrum of womanhood and to the oft-underrated bonds of female friendship.

Heat and Light by Jennifer Haigh. Ecco.

In this sensitive and sweeping novel, Haigh returns to the fictional Bakerton, a mining village overtaken by ���fracking frenzy�۝ in the late 2010s. The locals are divided over whether to lease their land to an unscrupulous energy company; transient drillers flood into the bars with their lusts and sorrows; activists descend; salesmen make bargains with the townsfolk, the devil, and themselves. By the end of the book�۪s 430 pages, Haigh�۪s patient, cumulative arguments (about greed, faith, chance, and community) have achieved real sonority, and we feel fully invested in her individual characters. Heat and Light is that rare ���ambitious social novel�۝ whose interlocking pieces are as vividly and precisely realized as its panoramic themes.

Modern Lovers by Emma Straub. Riverhead.

Read Slate�۪s review.

As she demonstrated with her witty The Vacationers, Straub has charm to spare. In Modern Lovers, an ensemble novel about more-or-less forlorn fortysomethings in twee Brooklyn, her trademark nimbleness serves a story of startling emotional depth. Straub�۪s adult characters (some of whom played together in a punk band) can�۪t quite relinquish the dream of youth; their children don�۪t know how to grow up, either. Disruptions small and large break across their interconnected paths, and there is deep satisfaction in watching an author as psychologically astute and empathetic as Straub play out their various responses. But the purest joys of the novel come from rooting for these relatably rudderless people as they attempt to sail into maturity with a modicum of grace.

Moonglow by Michael Chabon. Harper.

Read Slate�۪s review.

Again, you may be shocked���shocked!���to learn that the latest novel from Pulitzer Prize���winning author Chabon, a shimmering ���memoir�۝ about his grandparents, is among the year�۪s best. But the pleasure of surrendering to Chabon�۪s remarkable skills as a storyteller can�۪t be overstated. He excels on every level: his gorgeous, funny, looping sentences; his knack for the harlequin escapade; his deft swerves into emotional honesty and power; his intuitive mastery of suspense, tension, and release. Plus, American hero Ramon the cat deserves all the accolades for his third-act moment of bravery. Go Ramon!

My Name Is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout. Random House.

In Strout�۪s deceptively quiet hands, a line of dialogue can seem simple or commonplace until it begins to burn, a glowing coal plucked from the furnace of some character�۪s psyche. My Name Is Lucy Barton is a masterpiece of slow-dawning meaning, an interrogation of family relationships that takes as its occasion an older woman�۪s visit to the bedside of her convalescent daughter. (And that�۪s all I�۪m going to say about the plot!)

Night of the Animals by Bill Broun. Ecco.

In the England of 2052, an authoritarian king lords over a broken, drug-addled society, while the internet plays directly on people�۪s corneas and suicide cultists seek salvation in the murder of animals. Homeless, nonagenarian addict Cuthbert believes he can save the world by releasing the creatures in the London Zoo, a task that plunges him deep into Celtic myth, the intrigues of the dystopian police state, and the scattered phantasms of his buried past. Broun�۪s ���Brexit novel,�۝ acquiring new resonance under the sign of Trump, is an eerie, wildly original debut���a blur of beauty and madness, like van Gogh�۪s Starry Night.

This novel���about an academic malcontent; his accidentally revolutionary mother; and the constellation of students, family members, blowhard politicians, reactionary cops, video game addicts, ghosts, and Norwegian hobgoblins encircling them���is a Thanksgiving banquet of a book, a narrative table groaning with dishes both delicious and overdone. Hill, a gifted satirist whose lambasting of special-snowflake millennials and escapist gamer nerds can feel too broad, slips in tone from intelligent and realist to zanily experimental to lush and dreamy. His 600-page opus is an extravaganza of talent, a beautiful and idiosyncratic mess that for all its flashiness finds its most expressive voice when exploring basic human themes: love, anger, loneliness, regret.

In Winters�۪ speculative portrait of present-day America, slavery persists in four states (the ���Hard Four�۝), and hypercompetent government agents track down fugitives with the amoral aplomb of James Bond. One such operative is Victor, a freed slave whose nightmarish past keeps erupting into his detective work. The book is profligate with its noir tropes, funny, gripping, imaginative, and inexorable as it gradually unmasks the unthinkable evil at its core. The storyline, in other words, doubles as a descent���and there is always further down to go.

Whitehead, who won this year�۪s National Book Award for fiction, isn�۪t hurting for laurels���and yet it�۪s hard to imagine drafting a list of 2016�۪s mightiest books without including this phantasmagorical slash into the dark gut of American racism. Cora, an escaped slave, travels through the South on a literal subterranean train, each stop an object lesson in a different ghoulish facet of white supremacy. Her resolve and dignity are moving���but it�۪s the author�۪s playfulness and unpredictability that elevate this traditional tale of hardship into something singular, fugitive, and strange.

This memoir, from a literary-minded neurosurgeon who is diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in his 30s, is poetic and generous, intimate and profound. In clear and flowing prose, Kalanithi describes his self-formation as a doctor and then the evaporation of that identity as he becomes, again, a patient, starving for time. If some sections of the book are rougher or more abstract than others, the overall work recalls a world of almost pre-Christian luminousness, in which classical concepts like virtue, honor, and excellence still have purchase, chance or fate reigns supreme, and no person can evade the dark forever.

Why Glenn Beck Really Hates Steve Bannon,"There has been something delightfully ironic about watching Glenn Beck become one of the sanest voices in conservative media over this past year.

The Texas-based right-wing radio host and founder of The Blaze website���who once declared that Barack Obama has a ���deep-seated hatred for white people�۝���was #NeverTrump from the beginning of the GOP primaries. He initially threw his weight behind Ted Cruz and didn�۪t budge from his anti-Trump stance even after Cruz decided to endorse the man who insulted his wife and blamed his father for the JFK assassination.

As Election Day approached, Beck openly toyed with the idea of voting for Hillary Clinton, criticized Trump during the third presidential debate for his baffling incoherence on abortion, and called FBI Director James Comey ���irresponsible�۝ for tossing an October grenade into the race at the last minute.

Throughout the race, however, Beck has reserved his harshest words for Steve Bannon, who just this weekend was named President-elect Trump�۪s chief strategist. But is Beck�۪s great moral outrage over the self-proclaimed leader of the alt-right as selfless as it seems? Or is it personal?

It was all the way back in February of this year, when Cruz still had a chance and months before Trump had hired Bannon to serve as his campaign CEO, that Beck launched his attack.

���I�۪m telling you that I believe that Bannon thinks he�۪s either going to be the chief of staff or he�۪s going to be the next Roger Ailes,�۝ Beck said, presciently. He accused the Breitbart executive chairman of ���taking orders from a political candidate�۝ and ���reworking your entire site to promote the lies of a specific candidate without any kind of truth behind these things.�۝ In Beck�۪s view, that made Bannon more like Joseph Goebbels than Ailes.

���Andrew Breitbart would be spinning in his grave right now,�۝ Beck said, referring to the late founder of Breitbart.com.

But as it turns out, neither Breitbart nor Bannon were big fans of Beck, who launched The Blaze as a direct competitor to Breitbart after he was let go by Ailes and Fox News.

A few months after Beck started broadcasting his GBTV show online in 2011, Andrew Breitbart went on Steve Bannon�۪s ���Victory Sessions�۝ podcast, and the two men spent a good deal of time trashing their new competition.

Beck had made some provocative comments comparing Newt Gingrich to Barack Obama and suggested Tea Partiers only liked Gingrich because he was white, and Breitbart and Bannon accused Beck of ���race-baiting.�۝

���In the past, Beck has made a lot of mistakes, and his supporters come out and try to defend him, because Beck is a coward and will not defend himself when he makes a mistake or lies about a person or steals content,�۝ Breitbart said.

Egging him on, Bannon replied, ���Hold on, I want to go back over this: You�۪re saying that Glenn Beck�۪s a coward, Glenn Beck�۪s a liar, and you�۪re saying that Glenn Beck steals material from people?�۝

���Oh yes, and this is well-documented,�۝ Breitbart said, laying out what he viewed as Beck�۪s deliberately misleading coverage of the Shirley Sherrod scandal, which began its life on Breitbart�۪s Big Government website. He went on to say that Beck has been known to ���take countless bloggers�۪ content, to turn it into book gold, to turn it into chalkboard gold, his infamous chalkboards,�۝ an allegation explored in detail by The Daily Caller�۪s Matthew Boyle earlier that year.

Asked by Bannon what he would like to see Beck do next, Breitbart said, ���At this point, I don�۪t care what he does because he�۪s dead to me.�۝

Five years later, Bannon had officially joined the Trump campaign and Beck was openly calling him ���quite possibly the most dangerous guy in all of American politics�۝ and a ���horrible, despicable human being.�۝ His assertion that Bannon uses the ���Dark Web�۝ to exact revenge on his enemies landed Beck on Breitbart�۪s list of the ��� six dumbest claims �۝ journalists made about Bannon.

After news broke that Bannon would be joining Trump in the White House, Beck once again warned against Bannon�۪s ���clear tie to white nationalists,�۝ adding, ���He�۪s a terrifying man.�۝

These sentiments were echoed on Monday by Dana Loesch, who sued Breitbart���citing an ���increasingly hostile�۝ work environment���before joining The Blaze, during her live show. ���Steve Bannon puts himself above everything,�۝ she said of her former boss. ���I just don�۪t think this is a good fit for the country. Maybe it is for Steve Bannon, but it�۪s not a good fit for the country.�۝ Loesch suggested that Bannon will enter the White House with ���vengeance�۝ and ���pettiness�۝ in his heart, which should alone ���disqualify�۝ him from advising the president.

When Beck first joked that Bannon was angling to be Trump�۪s chief of staff earlier this year, he had no idea how right he would end up being. That job may have ended up going to Reince Priebus, but it was Bannon who got top billing on the official press release. In the end, Bannon�۪s ambitions far exceeded being the next Roger Ailes.

Now, a man who has never hid his disgust for Beck is about to become arguably the second most powerful person in Washington, if not the country. And at the same time, Trump and his team have made every indication that they intend to act hostilely toward a ���rigged�۝ media that they believe has been biased against them from the beginning.

It is yet another irony that Beck now finds himself in their crosshairs along with the rest of us.",The Blaze founder has become an unlikely voice of reason on the right.

BREAKING: Top Trump Adviser Drops Bombshell... Wednesday Is the END of Hillary's Campaign,"One of Donald Trump�۪s top surrogates made news when he intimated that a WikiLeaks release of information on Hillary Clinton, which he says will happen Wednesday, could finish her campaign.

In a Twitter posting this weekend, Trump adviser and Republican political consultant Roger Stone said that the information, which he says will be released Wednesday, will somehow end Hillary Clinton�۪s campaign.

���Wednesday @Hillary Clinton is done. #Wikileaks,�۝ Stone tweeted.

https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/782443074874138624 ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw

The information was originally scheduled to be released Tuesday, but NBC News (via Heat Street) reported WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ordered the release pushed back due to ���security concerns.�۝

TRENDING: How Trump Brilliantly Screwed Over Red State Dem Senators with Kavanaugh Nomination

Those security concerns are hardly illusory, especially when one is dealing with the left. Back in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a huge trove of classified diplomatic cables that embarrassed the Obama administration and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, liberal commentator Bob Beckel recommended that Assange be assassinated, suggesting during a Fox News television appearance that someone ���shoot the son of a bitch!�۝

Assange also intimated after his organization�۪s leak of Democratic National Committee documents that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich had been one of the organization�۪s sources. According to The Hill, that hasn�۪t stopped the organization, which has said it plans to release more information on Clinton before the Nov. 8 election.

It is unknown whether the delayed information will actually be released on Wednesday, but Stone seems to believe, from his tweet, that it will be.

WikiLeaks�۪ most significant information dump on the Democrats, which occurred right before the Democratic National Convention in July, confirmed that the party organization was operating as a de facto arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign and was actively working to undermine the insurgent campaign of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.

The emails also exposed coordination between the DNC and the media.

How much more damaging are these emails than those that WikiLeaks has already released? If Roger Stone is right, this could be the biggest information dump in the organization�۪s history. Stay tuned.

Donald Trump's Rumored Game Plan For The Debate Is Making Some VERY Nervous,"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:

The second presidential debate is tonight. In some ways, I think it�۪ll be more interesting than the first. (I actually found the first debate a bit��_underwhelming.)

Trump�۪s all warmed up. I�۪m sure he�۪s taken the advice of his critics and advisors. I�۪m expecting him to REALLY show up tonight. I assumed he�۪d have a stronger debate performance the second time around anyway. But with all of the news that broke over the last few days��� Trump�۪s decade-old lewd comments and WikiLeaks�۪ document dump, revealing the content of Hillary�۪s top secret Wall Street speeches��� this debate should be even more interesting.

I�۪d love to see Trump�۪s debate strategy for tonight. I�۪m not going to lie. I�۪m nervous. I kinda want to approve it beforehand. (Another reason I love Pence so much. I don�۪t get nervous every time he opens his mouth.) Trump kept it pretty classy last time but had some serious missed opportunities. He didn�۪t hammer Hillary on the Clinton Foundation at all. He gets too caught up in defending every little detail of his life, and people aren�۪t interested in that. That�۪s why moderators pose questions the way they do. They know Trump will go down rabbit trails.

The biggest question today? Will Trump ���go there.�۝ You know what I mean. Will he bring up Bill Clinton�۪s infidelity and Hillary Clinton�۪s role as his enabler? I mean, if she�۪s going to bring up the remarks Trump made about women 10+ years ago, it�۪s fair game, right?

It looks like that�۪s the plan.

That�۪s what I�۪m afraid of. In a sane world, people would go, ���Oh yeah. Hillary is married to a rapist and intimidated his victims. Donald Trump just said something disgusting. Apples and oranges.�۝ But this isn�۪t a sane world.

"WATCH: Punk Tries to Ruin Concert for Vets, So Luke Bryan PUNCHES Him From Stage","Country singer Luke Bryan performed at Nashville�۪s Bridgestone Arena Wednesday as part of Charlie Daniel�۪s 80th birthday all-star Volunteer Jam ��� a concert that raised money for military veterans, Taste of Country reported.

Sadly, one concert-goer decided to make an obscene gesture, and Bryan didn�۪t take it sitting down ��� he punched the man from the stage.

In the middle of a song, a man in the front row decided to give Bryan the middle finger. Bryan reportedly yelled ���Come on,�۝ before he went ahead and punched the man, according to Us Weekly. Bryan then gathered himself and went on with his performance.

Take a look at a video of the altercation below both on Twitter and an up-close version posted to YouTube:

https://twitter.com/_kelseymeador/status/804188938265042944 ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw

After the altercation, Rolling Stone posted a statement from Bryan�۪s team:

���A man in (the) front row was making crude hand gestures toward Luke during his performance. It was insulting not only to him, but more importantly to the men, women and families sitting around him who were there to support and celebrate Charlie Daniels and the efforts of raising money for the military veterans ��� some of who were in the audience. The concert security personnel saw the man�۪s disruptive actions of the event and he was escorted out.�۝

The obscene gesture was apparently the tip of the iceberg, according to Rolling Stone, which reported that there were two hecklers in the crowd, one with an insulting sign that referenced Bryan�۪s famous tight jeans.

Although it�۪s not a great idea to punch a guy in the front row ��� if only for your own safety ��� it is understandable why Bryan did it. The event was meant to raise money for vets and the man�۪s actions were extremely disrespectful.

Fortunately, as Taste of Country reported, the man was escorted out by security and the event wasn�۪t hampered ��� $240,000 was raised that night for the Journey Home Project which works to help veteran�۪s lives in a variety of ways.

To behave like that person did is unacceptable ��� especially at an event to raise money for veterans. There�۪s no excuse for it, and while Bryan probably should have kept his cool, sometimes people reap what the sow.

Samsung raided in Park corruption probe,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ms Park has seen her approval ratings plummet amid the scandal

South Korean authorities have raided the offices of Samsung and the national pension fund as part of a corruption investigation linked to the president.

They are probing whether Park Geun-hye pressured the fund to support a Samsung merger, said the Yonhap news agency.

In return, Samsung is alleged to have given financial favours to Ms Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, Yonhap said.

The scandal has led to growing calls for Ms Park's resignation, but she has said the allegations are ""fantasy"".

Ms Choi, who has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud, is accused of using her close relationship with Ms Park to obtain favours and funds for her own gain.

Earlier this week prosecutors said Ms Park had a ""considerable"" role in the scandal.

The allegations have enraged the South Korean public, and caused Ms Park's approval ratings to plummet. However, she has resisted the calls for her to resign and has yet to agree to be questioned by investigators.

Her spokesman rejected the prosecutors' case as speculation built on ""a house of fantasy"".

Image copyright EPA Image caption South Koreans have staged demonstrations calling for Ms Park's resignation

Samsung's offices had already been raided over related allegations.

Wednesday's raid had to do with a merger last year between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries.

The deal went through despite significant opposition from shareholders, who said it would hurt minority shareholders while benefiting the family of Samsung's group owner Lee Kun-hee.

South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), which owns stakes in both companies, sealed the deal by voting in favour of it.

Prosecutors allege that Samsung gave ���2.8m euros ($3.1m;�2.5m) to a company co-owned by Ms Choi and her daughter, in return for Ms Park's support for the deal.

Samsung was also among several conglomerates that gave millions of dollars to two non-profit foundations owned by Ms Choi, after the latter allegedly pressured them for donations.

Samsung and the pension fund confirmed the raids without giving further details.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption At the centre of the probe is Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Park Geun-hye

Ms Park is accused of giving Ms Choi inappropriate access to government policy-making and decisions.

She has since acknowledged that she committed lapses, and apologised twice on national television.

Separately on Wednesday, Ms Park's office confirmed a report that they had bought hundreds of Viagra pills on behalf of the president.

"Sorry, I gotta get this off of my chest.","They deserve so much better than Trump.

Anybody who knows me knows that I�۪m not easily offended. Part of it is past job and sports decisions I�۪ve made. If you�۪re a standup comic and you can�۪t take occasional taunts and heckling, you�۪re in the wrong business. I had a drunk charge the stage one time. The bouncer caught him, and I stood there blowing kisses at him while the bouncer dragged him out and the crowd laughed like hell. Don�۪t play organized hockey, even at the college or social club level if you can�۪t take boos and nasty comments from the stands. And if you�۪re gonna cry every time your coach screams that you�۪re a dumb shit, you need a new hobby.

But now I�۪m highly offended. Trumps�۪ wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier today made my skin crawl. I come from a military family. My father was a veteran, I couldn�۪t stop sobbing when they gave me the flag that draped his casket at Lincoln National cemetery. I have an uncle who died in a jeep accident in Germany on active duty, and a great uncle who lies at rest somewhere in the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, I�۪ve seen his name on the wall of the memorial. I lost two close friends who were coworkers in Afghanistan, I attended both of the funerals. Even though I�۪ll be 60 next month, I still carry my Vietnam era draft card in my wallet. This is personal to me.

It turned my stomach to watch that fat, arrogant orange penguin, who has sacrificed nothing and no one in his life, and who has so little respect for our brave troops that he referred to his swinging lifestyle in New York in the ���70s as his own personal Vietnam, even though he received phony deferments to keep from going to Vietnam, wrapping his tiny fingers around that wreath and placing it in front of the tomb of brave, anonymous men who sacrificed everything so that he could grab women by the crotch with impunity.

Eight people 'as rich as poorest half',"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Superyachts are the calling card of some ultra-wealthy individuals

The world's eight richest individuals have as much wealth as the 3.6bn people who make up the poorest half of the world, according to Oxfam.

The charity said its figures, which critics have queried, came from improved data, and the gap between rich and poor was ""far greater than feared"".

The richest eight include Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett.

Mark Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said Oxfam should focus instead on ways to boost growth.

""As an 'anti-poverty' charity, Oxfam seems to be strangely preoccupied with the rich,"" said the director-general of the free market think tank.

For those concerned with ""eradicating absolute poverty completely"", the focus should be on measures that encourage economic growth, he added.

Ben Southwood, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, said it was not the wealth of the world's rich that mattered, but the welfare of the world's poor, which was improving every year.

""Each year we are misled by Oxfam's wealth statistics. The data is fine - it comes from Credit Suisse - but the interpretation is not.""

'Elite gathering'

Oxfam's report coincides with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, a Swiss ski resort. The annual event attracts many of the world's top political and business leaders.

Katy Wright, Oxfam's head of global external affairs, said the report helped the charity to ""challenge the political and economic elites"".

""We're under no illusions that Davos is anything other than a talking shop for the world's elite, but we try and use that focus,"" she added.

The world's eight richest billionaires

1. Bill Gates (US): co-founder of Microsoft (net worth $75bn)

2. Amancio Ortega (Spain): founder of Zara owner Inditex (net worth $67bn)

3. Warren Buffett (US): largest shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway (net worth $60.8bn)

4. Carlos Slim Helu (Mexico): owner of Grupo Carso (net worth $50bn)

5. Jeff Bezos (US): founder and chief executive of Amazon (net worth $45.2bn)

6. Mark Zuckerberg (US): co-founder and chief executive of Facebook (net worth $44.6bn)

7. Larry Ellison (US): co-founder and chief executive of Oracle (net worth $43.6bn)

8. Michael Bloomberg (US): owner of Bloomberg LP (net worth $40bn)

Source: Forbes billionaires' list, March 2016

UK economist Gerard Lyons said focusing on extreme wealth ""does not always give the full picture"" and attention should be paid to ""making sure the economic cake is getting bigger"".

However, he said Oxfam was right to single out companies that it believed fuelled inequality with business models that were ""increasingly focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives"".

Oxfam's Ms Wright said economic inequality was fuelling a polarisation in politics, citing Donald Trump's election as US president and the Brexit vote as examples.

'Fair share'

""People are angry and calling out for alternatives. They're feeling left behind because however hard they work they can't share in their country's growth,"" she said.

The charity is calling for ""a more human economy"" and is urging governments to crack down on executive pay and tax evasion and impose higher taxes on the wealthy.

It also wants business leaders to pay a ""fair share of tax"" and has urged companies to pay staff the ""living wage"", which is higher than the government's National Living Wage.

Oxfam has produced similar reports for the past four years. In 2016 it calculated that the richest 62 people in the world had as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population.

The number had fallen to just eight this year because more accurate data was now available, Oxfam said.

It was still the case that the world's richest 1% had as much wealth as the rest of the world combined, Oxfam said.

Some of the eight richest billionaires have given away tens of billions of dollars. In 2000 Bill Gates and his wife Melinda set up a private foundation that has an endowment of more than $44bn.

In 2015 Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan pledged to give away 99% of their net worth in their lifetimes, which equated to about $45bn based on the value of Facebook shares at the time.

It takes cash and assets worth $71,600 to get into the top 10%, and $744,396 to be in the top 1%.

Oxfam's report is based on data from Forbes and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth datebook, which gives the distribution of global wealth going back to 2000.

The survey uses the value of an individual's assets, mainly property and land, minus debts, to determine what he or she ""owns"". The data excludes wages or income.

The methodology has been criticised as it means that a student with high debts, but with high future earning potential, for example, would be considered poor under the criteria used.",Oxfam research finds the eight richest billionaires have as much wealth as 3.6 billion people combined.,"['Business Reporter', 'Bbc News', 'In Davos', 'Katie Hope']",http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,4,7,844,16,0,0,0.104166667,0.149587647,0.2,0
Rob Lowe says players who boycott national anthem on 9/11 should stay in locker room,"Colin Kaepernick�۪s protest against the national anthem has sparked an ongoing debate about the obligation of players to stand ��� or not stand ��� during the anthem.

Many players have joined with Kaepernick�۪s protest in solidarity, but with the first Sunday of NFL season falling on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks, many think it would be inappropriate for players to not stand on such a sad day.

Rob Lowe is one of them, and on Saturday, he tweeted saying that the NFL should ask players to stay in the locker room rather than publicly protest the anthem.

"���Hard to get inside Mosul, over 1mn people still trapped amid op�۪ ��� Oxfam representative to RT","Humanitarian organizations face serious difficulties in delivering aid to people inside Iraq�۪s Mosul amid the US-backed operation against Islamic State, Oxfam spokesman who returned from Iraq told RT. Over 1 million people are still trapped in the city.

""Unfortunately, it�۪s very difficult for humanitarian agencies like Oxfam to get into Mosul itself,"" Kai Tabacek, Oxfam's digital press officer said in an interview to RT. He returned just a month ago from the area of Irbil, which is 90 kilometers from Mosul.

According to Tabacek, some 100,000 people have managed to flee the violence in Mosul, yet approximately 10 times more are still in the city and facing a ���dire humanitarian situation.�۝



After almost two months of operation to liberate Mosul ���we have more than 100,000 people who have fled the city and surrounding areas,�۝ the Oxfam representative said. ���Still more than a million people, we believe, are trapped inside Mosul and they are at risk from being caught by sniper fire, explosive devices. And it's really important that all sides in this conflict provide safe escape routes for those people to leave.�۝



Mosul was captured by Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) back in 2014 and later turned into a self-proclaimed capital of the jihadists in Iraq. The operation to retake the key city started on October 17, with tens of thousands of Iraqi military, special forces and militias taking part. The mission is also supported by the US-led international coalition.

���The situation is not great, particularly with winter arriving in Iraq,�۝ Tabacek said. Yet ���so far most of the displaced families leaving Mosul have been able to access some form of assistance from Oxfam and from others [humanitarian organizations].""

Read more

The Oxfam press officer also noted that it�۪s crucial for all sides to avoid using heavy weaponry inside the city since it puts civilian lives at risk.



���It�۪s very worrying when there is a conflict that close to where the people are living and we�۪ve seen in other places and in Mosul so far, the way ISIS seem willing to use people as human shields,�۝ Tabacek warned.



He also said that liberating Mosul won�۪t automatically eliminate the humanitarian crisis in the area: ���More than 3 million people that are displaced in northern Iraq. And that�۪s not only from Mosul, that's a number of other areas that have been recaptured in the last few years. This is a crisis that is not going to go away anytime soon,�۝ Tabacek said.



Meanwhile, the operation to retake Mosul has slowed down in the past weeks since the Iraqi army and militias are going deeper into the city. In addition, an early December report by Debkafiles, a military intelligence news site with links to the Israeli military, said Islamic State is now mulling to stay put in their Iraqi stronghold. According to the report, a delegation of IS commanders arrived in Mosul on December 4, to discuss synchronizing the city defenses with those of Raqqa in Syria. Mosul commanders have ���changed course about leaving the city and decided to stay put,�۝ the paper said.

WATCH: Bill Maher HAMMERS Trump In Final Plea To Voters On Fallon,"Bill Maher made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and made sure everyone knows exactly who Donald trump is and why we shouldn�۪t vote for him.

Fallon asked for Maher�۪s thoughts on the election and he did not disappoint. Maher conceded that Hillary is not the best candidate, but said she will be a good president.

He then slammed Trump for cheering for Russian hackers to keep committing espionage against the United States.

When the subject of ���locker room talk�۝ came up, Maher was even more emphatic.

Maher said that what Trump said is not ���locker room talk,�۝ it�۪s a guy bragging about committing sexual assault. ���GOP now stands for grab our p*ssies,�۝ Maher declared.

When Fallon joked that it sounds like Maher supports Trump, Maher got serious.

���It�۪s not funny,�۝ he said. ���This is a different thing.�۝

���I did a whole mea culpa on my show Friday night, I talked about Mitt Romney, George Bush, Reagan, McCain like it was the end of the world. It would never have been the end of the world with those guys. This is different. This guy is different. They have no respect for the rule of law. It�۪s only about vengeance.�۝

When asked what he would say to undecided voters, Maher made things simple.

���First of all, really? I mean, he�۪s a racist, a liar, a tax cheat, a deadbeat, a Russian agent, and a sexual predator. ���How do you find your way out of the door in the morning?�۪ is what I would say to the undecideds.�۝

Maher concluded by slamming conservatives for creating an alternate reality where America is failing and President Obama did a horrible jobs. The facts, however, paint a different story before unemployment is down to 4.9 percent and the stock market has more than recovered since the Great Recession.

Here�۪s the video via YouTube.

Americans need to vote in this election no matter what. The future of this nation depends on it.

Restoring Free Speech: The Trump Effect,"Trump has Americans timidly coming out from the shadows; feeling a little less afraid of exercising their Constitutional right to express their religious and political views

Restoring Free Speech: The Trump Effect

Years ago, Rush Limbaugh coined the term, ���Low-info Voters.�۝ The term perfectly describes Americans, like 95% of my family, who only get their news from the mainstream media. Consequently, low-info voters do not know that the mainstream media is not fair and balanced. The mainstream media has become strong-arm enforcers of political correctness and operatives of the Democrat Party; 100% focused and committed to furthering the socialist/progressive agenda. Yes, I remember when I was a kid my black Baltimore City firefighter dad told me, ���The Republicans are for the rich and the Democrats are for the little guy; the working man.�۝

A few years ago, I was able to convince my 89-year-old dad that this ���ain�۪t�۝ his Democrat Party of his youth. Dad�۪s Democrat Party has been hijacked by old hippies. They reject Christianity while vowing to arrest anyone speaking badly of Islam. They use public schools to teach our kids to despise all things traditional, wholesome, patriotic and good. They are the ones who have, for the most part, made it criminal to publicly say you believe marriage should remain as it has been for thousands of years and how God intended; between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24). They are the ones banning Nativity scenes and banning saying ���Merry Christmas.�۝ They are the ones banning teachers addressing students as boys and girls, claiming gender distinctions are intolerant, discriminatory and bigoted. They are the ones pushing the extinction of blacks via a disproportionate high number of black abortions. This it why it continues to frost me when low-info idiots in my black ���Christian�۝ family continue to pledge their brain-dead loyalty to Democrats while calling me their Uncle Tom relative. The Left uses a highly effective tactic. They brand any push-back to them cramming their progressive agenda down our throats ���extremism.�۝ This tactic works great with so many low-info voters.

Here is how it works. The Left says they want burly men with beards, dressed like lumberjacks to be permitted to use women restrooms if they inwardly feel like a woman that day. Husbands, fathers and brothers across America politically said, No-way. We are not allowing grown men in restrooms with our little girls, wives and mothers. Government mandating this insane restroom policy and Leftist businesses like Target embracing it has led to rapes and molestation in women restrooms. And yet, guess who the mainstream media and Democrats attack, calling them extremist? Answer: All who oppose men in women restrooms. In an attempt to demonize and silence American�۪s common-sense disagreement, the Left claims anyone opposing men in women restrooms hates homosexuals and want to see them tortured and murdered. If you oppose the Left removing crosses from memorials, removing the Ten Commandments from public buildings, banning Nativity scenes and banning saying ���Merry Christmas�۝, the Left claims you�۪re an extremist who hates homosexuals, suppresses women and want to cram your religion down everyone�۪s throat. Do you see how the Left�۪s extremism tactic works? They are the aggressors, but call you an extremist when you simply say, ���No.�۝ Clearly, the Left has launched a pedal-to-the-metal campaign to cram their progressive agenda down our throats. For example: A Zales jewelry TV commercial featured a lesbian wedding. Homosexuals are only 2% of the population. So why is featuring a lesbian wedding necessary? Fearful to admit it, most Americans still instinctively know marriage is between one man and one woman. But if they dare say it out loud, the Left will try to destroy them by branding their belief in tradition and biblical teaching extreme; outrageously claiming they hate homosexuals and want to see them tortured and murdered. The Left�۪s tactic of branding the slightest opposition ���extremism�۝ has silenced many. I believe Trump in the WH has already begun liberating Americans from the Left�۪s tyranny of political correctness; muzzling free speech. I realize the Left will distort my statement to mean Trump has opened the flood gates to express hate. Nonsense.

Continued below... Leftists are boldly, relentlessly spewing hate against Jesus, Christians, Republicans, Conservatives (black and white), white people and police The truth is Leftists are the ones who boldly and relentlessly spew hate against Jesus, Christians, Republicans, Conservatives (black and white), white people and police. Heck, Leftists have even given marching orders to their minions, declaring it open season on killing whites and police. Have you heard the slightest rebuke from the mainstream media? No. All I am saying is Trump has Americans timidly coming out from the shadows; feeling a little less afraid of exercising their Constitutional right to express their religious and political views. And that brothers and sisters is good for all Americans.

Opinion | The Senate Bathroom Angle,"We are sorely in need of some cheerful news out of Washington, so I�۪m going to tell you Barbara Mikulski�۪s story about the Senate bathrooms.

Almost every veteran woman legislator, in every level of government, has a story about the shortage of bathroom facilities at work. Really, there needs to be a book on this. It could have a happy ending, and none of the chapters would involve Russian attempts to manipulate an election.

Mikulski, 80, has served in Congress longer than any other woman in history. She�۪s retiring this month after representing Maryland for 30 years in the Senate. Before that she spent 10 years in the House. She was a social worker who got into Democratic politics during a battle to stop a planned highway that was threatening the ethnic Baltimore neighborhoods she loved. It was an unusual career route at the time, but she was an unusual person. ���One of the things they said was that I didn�۪t look the part,�۝ Mikulski, who is 4-foot-11, recalled. ��ω�_ You know, chunky and I have a definite blue-collar style, so I wasn�۪t to the manner born, to the trust fund inherited.�۝

The classic way for a woman to win a seat in the Senate was to follow a famous male relative. Many of her predecessors were widows who succeeded their husbands. Nancy Kassebaum, the only other woman in the Senate when Mikulski arrived, was the daughter of the Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon.","We are sorely in need of some cheerful news out of Washington, so I�۪m going to tell you Barbara Mikulski�۪s story.",[],http://www.nytimes.com,0,0,0,0,6,244,21,0,0,0,0.2075,0.4,0

The Every Student Succeeds Act will Fail - The Boston Globe,"Across the country, schools and school districts have begun to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. The law is the latest reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first passed in 1965. Yet, despite the fanfare and promise to usher in a new era, this newest version ��� like so many federal and state schemes to implement high standards for student learning ��� will fail. The regulatory process associated with implementation will inevitably corrupt the law�۪s intent.

I have witnessed this again and again in my 35 years as a teacher ��� a front-row seat from which I have viewed the deadening impact on schools and classrooms of standards as regulatory tools. At the same time, however, I have also been inspired by the inventive ways that school-level educators and communities have used similar standards to foster powerful learning.

In 1989, I joined a circle of colleagues and parents frustrated by the focus on testing of the well-regarded high school in our suburban community near Albany, N.Y. At the time, New York State�۪s curriculum consisted of thick manuals with long lists of learning objectives and a battery of tests, the vaunted Regents Exams. Our small group asked: How can we engage students in learning more fully beyond a narrow desire to ace the exam?

Over the course of several years we designed and launched an alternative school-within-a-school, in which tests took a back seat to projects designed to simulate real world problems. Each semester, students in the Bethlehem Lab School presented their work before a panel of adults drawn from the community. The high stakes of a juried exhibition pushed our students to focus, and the complex nature of the work forced them to think more deeply and broadly than they were accustomed.

Our students didn�۪t take Regents Exams. At the time, students in New York State could opt for a ���local�۝ diploma instead. We chose this lower status designation as an entire school to free ourselves to create a more demanding curriculum, based on New York State�۪s own learning standards. It turned out that at the back of all those thick curriculum books put out by the state stood an elegantly simple list of 10 goals. It fit on one page. It was our constitution. And though the Regents curriculum was, theoretically, based on the 10 goals, the process of parsing out learning objectives in each subject and the demands of psychometricians for reliability and validity resulted in a curriculum overweight with content, instruction focused on memorization, and tests that rewarded students able to retain lots and lots of information. The system demanded compliance more than it fostered learning.

Several years later, I was invited to join a new public charter school in Massachusetts as principal teacher. The Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School was founded by parents and educators who pioneered an approach to standards and assessment in which each student continuously created original work assembled into a portfolio. Revision was encouraged, and standards were printed on posters hung on the walls of every classroom. Students worked hard to improve their essays, lab reports, and projects until they met the standards, and when they demonstrated to their teachers and classmates through a live exhibition that the standards were met, they were promoted.

Those were heady times in Massachusetts. The Education Reform Act of 1993 that enabled charter schools also promised a statewide assessment system to include portfolios and other forms of ���authentic�۝ assessment like those at the Lab School and the Parker School. But first, under political pressure, regulators were compelled to generate thick manuals of finely parsed learning objectives. Then, the psychometricians went to work figuring out how to measure learning. Shortly, the Department of Education rolled out a battery of on-demand tests, with the grandiose title of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or what we know today more often as the MCAS. No portfolios and nothing authentic about them. Again, compliance ruled the day. Teachers and students would have to fall in line.

2001 saw passage of the No Child Left Behind Act. Standards as regulatory tool, in force in some states, became the law of the land. They called it accountability.

In 2006, after 25 years in schools, I reinvented myself as an assistant professor at a nearby university. I wanted to know: Were my experiences part of a larger pattern? I quickly learned two things. The first is that there is a boatload of research showing that accountability has narrowed the curriculum nationwide and turned schools serving our nation�۪s neediest students into test prep factories. And the second is legions of education researchers have seized on the rising tide of test data to answer their questions. The answers are often simplistic in ways that belie the complexity of schools and classrooms, while legitimizing the testing culture.

As evidence has mounted that the accountability regime is turning many schools into test prep centers, advocates for accountability have argued that schools need not slavishly teach to the test. Instead, they say, schools should offer a robust curriculum with demanding instruction, and the tests will take care of themselves. This sounds like common sense, but in a study I just completed with Megin Charner-Laird of Salem State University and Stacy Szczesiul of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, we found that schools with reliably high test scores ��� while not teaching to the test per se ��� tend to teach a limited range of skills required for the test. Teachers and administrators told us they would aspire to something more, but this is what the system demands.

At schools like the Lab School and the Parker School, demanding standards, attached to assessments that rely on judgment, foster powerful learning. At the system level, strict reliance on measurement, where judgment is expunged as a contaminant, has served to narrow learning and diminish student engagement.

The Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA as it is known, holds on to this fundamental element of the accountability movement like a dog does a bone. Meanwhile, a Gallup Student Poll administered last fall shows 68 percent of high school juniors unengaged in school. Portfolios, juried exhibitions, external audits, peer review ��� all of which rely on judgment informed with evidence ��� have been marginalized at the system level, but they are exactly what works at the local level in pushing students to think deeply and engage in learning. Perhaps after ESSA fails to deliver, we will get the message, and a new policy regime will be driven not by the question how do we measure X, but, instead, how do we engage and inspire children and youth?

D.C. Police Will NOT Be Allowed To Have Their Body Cameras On While Monitoring Inaugural Protests,"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:

According to this, D.C. police officers will not be allowed to keep their body cameras on during the inaugural festivities in the nation�۪s capital Friday. They�۪ll only be able to turn the cameras on in the event of an escalation that requires police intervention. Some say that poses a problem, as officers won�۪t be able to record what led up to the disruption. Plus, doesn�۪t that kind of defeat the purpose of body cams? Oddly enough, the ACLU fully supports this move, which is incredibly confusing. Wasn�۪t it Democrats who begged for body cameras on police officers? What gives?

���We are concerned what they will do with the data,�۝ Monica Hopkins-Maxwell of the District of Columbia ACLU said.

And by that, she means she�۪s afraid that police will catch protesters acting like complete morons. At the same time, the ACLU is demanding that protesters closely monitor the behavior of police officers. They�۪re even promoting an app, Mobile Justice, which allows citizens to report questionable police behavior in real time.

���The more people who are watching, the less incidences of collisions between police and protesters,�۝ Hopkins-Maxwell continued.

So let me get this straight. Police shouldn�۪t monitor protesters, but protesters should DEFINITELY monitor police officers. The ACLU only wants recordings of officers misbehaving. Gotta protect the hooligans who are planning on disrupting the day�۪s events, of course.","According to this, D.C. police officers will not��be allowed to��keep their body cameras on during the inaugural festivities in the nation's capital Friday.

9/11 VERDICT: Mainstream Media Guilty Of The Biggest Coverup In U.S. History ( VIDEO



State of the Nation

���Every major organ of the Mainstream Media has

quite willingly participated in the ongoing cover-up

of the Crime of the Millennium���the 9/11 false flag

terror attacks in New York City and Washington.�۝[1]

��� Veteran 9/11 Investigator

To many it is now quite obvious that the mainstream media (MSM) is the real enemy of We the People.

Stated more accurately it is the owners of the MSM who are the real enemies of the American Republic.

Actually, it is those clandestine powers who control the MSM owners, via multiple control mechanisms, who are the true enemies of the American people ��_ as well as the world community of nations.

Indisputable Fact: Until this harsh reality is dealt with decisively and firmly,

there can be no real change throughout the planetary civilization.

Very few are aware, but whoever controls the mainstream media effectively controls the world. That�۪s because whoever controls the flow of information, controls the minds of the global population.

Whoever Controls The Media Controls The World

The next logical step in this critical research project is to ask:

Who REALLY Controls The Mainstream Media?

Why is the 9/11 cover-up so important?

The highly coordinated cover-up of the U.S. government-directed terror attacks on 9/11 is quite representative of all the major cover-ups throughout modern American history. The true perpetrators utilized the same MO as they did to cover-up the assassination of John of Kennedy ��_ the Oklahoma City Bombing ��_ the Sandy Hook School ���massacre�۪, etc. Hence, when one understands how they can successfully cover-up such a massive crime as 9/11, it is then easier to see why they routinely employ the same basic game plan whenever they so choose.

9/11 TRUTH GOES NUCLEAR: Massive Download In Progress

For anyone who has conducted even a modicum of research into the 9/11 black operation, it quickly becomes clear that not only did the U.S. Federal Government coordinate the biggest cover-up in American history, they could only have done so with the full knowledge and support of every major news platform within the MSM.[2]

9/11 Commission Report: The Most Ridiculous Conspiracy Theory Of All Time

Point of Fact: Without the intimate involvement of the MSM,

the 9/11 cover-up could not have succeeded.

TREASON & TRAITORS

In light of the [ONGOING] 9/11 cover-up, it can be stated with absolute certainty that the MSM is guilty of the cover-up of state-sponsored terrorism (by the US government), various crimes against humanity, the countless war crimes of the post 9/11 wars, and high treason of the highest order.

9/11 FACT: The Pentagon Was Hit By A Cruise Missile From The US Military Arsenal

Where it concerns the 9/11 false flag operation, the degree of treachery demonstrated by the MSM against the American people is unprecedented in its depth and breadth. Their profound betrayal of the U.S. citizenry through the implementation of the MSM cover-up is both shocking for its sheer audacity as it is stunning for its naked malevolence.

What is crucial to understand here is that where the original crime was carried out over 15 years ago, the enormous cover-up continues up to this very day. Therefore, the duration and severity and number of the myriad MSM cover-up crimes grows by the day. As matter of fact, the unprovoked wars of aggression prosecuted by the Obama Administration in the Mideast and elsewhere have only occurred only because of the success of the MSM 9/11 cover-up.

War on Terror Justified With 9/11 False Flag Terror Attacks

In view of this irrefutable state of affairs, it can be asserted that those who populate the highest echelons of the entire corporate media are traitors and turncoats. Who they really serve can only be surmised, but their loyalties do not lie with the American Republic. Because the continuing 9/11 cover-up requires so much day-to-day dissemination of known falsehoods and fabricated lies, those who staff the major organs of the MSM at even the lower levels are likewise guilty of treason.

There is only one realistic solution to this ever-worsening MSM predicament.

The mainstream media in its current form must be shut down and removed from American civil society. Or, it must be completely taken over by a newly constituted U.S. Federal Government that truly serves the interests of the American people, as well as the world-at-large.

Any endeavor that is undertaken that does not include one of these two execution plans is essentially worthless. That�۪s because there can be no meaningful dissemination of the truth, or reconciliation throughout the nation, until the power of the press is fully restored to the people themselves. Absent this successful initiative, there can be no justice, nor will there be any peace, at home or abroad. The influence of the American MSM is far too great worldwide and therefore needs to be radically transformed into a force for good.

Exactly how the new media platforms are constructed remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the country has seen everything about how NOT to run a media operation, so building a new enterprise based on truth, and run with integrity, ought to be fairly straightforward. It�۪s simply called: ���Tell the Truth���Always!�۝

Conclusion

The current corporate MSM must be shut down and taken over. The sooner the better, as no meaningful change can take place as long as it continues to operate against the interests of the American people.

Those individuals who own and operate, direct and oversee, the major corporate media companies need to be arrested post haste for treason and other serious crimes. They should be imprisoned without bail until their trials by jury can be conducted by a special 9/11 Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Within this legal framework and judicial format, they ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Many media analysts and political commentators in the alternative media have suggested that those who are found guilty ��� of both the 9/11 crimes and cover-up ��� must be given the harshest punishments possible to serve as a powerful deterrent to all future traitors to the American Republic.

GM is reinventing itself. Its cutting 15% of its salaried workers and shutting 5 plants in North America,"New York (CNN Business)General Motors on Monday announced a major restructuring of its global business, saying it will shut production at five facilities in North America and slash its staff. GM will reduce its salaried workforce by 15%, including a quarter of the company's executives.

The moves are the first big steps in the century-old GM's transformation. The company is reinvesting money away from cars that once dominated America's roadways and putting it into technology it believes will power its future.
GM's (GM) new motto is ""Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions, Zero Congestion,"" signaling a shift to self-driving, electric vehicles. But the restructuring is also about making cars people want now. Customers are increasingly shunning sedans in favor of SUVs and hatchbacks.
The company said the plan would make it more efficient, saving $6 billion a year by the end of 2020. GM said its slimmed down production plan would allow it to share technology across all of its vehicles and reduce the amount of time and workers it takes to build cars.
""The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future,"" said CEO Mary Barra, in a statement.
GM said it would shut operations at plants in Detroit; Oshawa, Ontario; Warren, Ohio; White Marsh, Maryland; and Warren, Michigan. The plants made sedans that have waned in popularity, including the Chevrolet Volt, Impala and Cruze, the Buick LaCrosse, and the Cadillac CT6 and XTS. Two of the plants made engines and parts for those cars. The facilities made some trucks, but those trucks are also made at in Mexico.
General Motors of the future
The company, which was incorporated in 1908, is battling rival automakers to be first in line to mass-produce the cars of the future. Ford (F) announced in April it would just about end all production of sedans in North America.
But the next automaking leader may not be GM or one of its traditional rivals. Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Uber and Tesla (TSLA) are leading Silicon Valley's push into the self-driving cars. That's why GM bought Cruise, a separate company with big backing from SoftBank and Honda. GM expects to spend $1 billion on Cruise this year to build the next generation of cars.
In the meantime, GM is trying to reinvent how it makes vehicles. It will share more components across cars and make better use of computer models and virtual tools. It will integrate its vehicle and engine engineering teams, and it will bring more employees together, trimming the number of campuses for car developers.
Global reaction
The Oshawa plant, located just outside of Toronto, was built in 1953. But Chevrolet has been making cars in Oshawa for more than a century. Over the years, Oshawa has been responsible for producing cars from GM's most important brands, including Chevrolet, Buick and Pontiac, and it is equipped to make just about every model GM sells.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision to shut the Oshawa, Ontario plant. ""GM workers have been part of the heart and soul of Oshawa for generations - and we'll do everything we can to help the families affected by this news get back on their feet.""

 GM workers have been part of the heart and soul of Oshawa for generations - and well do everything we can to help the families affected by this news get back on their feet. Yesterday, I spoke with @GMs Mary Barra to express my deep disappointment in the closure.

GM's unions aren't happy. The union that represents its Canadian workers said in a statement that GM's expected decision does not ""live up to the spirit"" of certain commitments the company made to union members during 2016 contract negotiations. Some workers at the Oshawa plant walked off the job Monday.
The four American plants employ a combined 3,800 hourly and salaried staff. The Detroit-Hamtramck facility is GM's last in the city, and the Lordstown plant in Ohio was one of its biggest.
The United Autoworkers union said it would fight the decision.
""This callous decision by GM to reduce or cease operations in American plants, while opening or increasing production in Mexico and China plants for sales to American consumers, is, in its implementation, profoundly damaging to our American workforce,"" said Terry Dittes, UAW Vice President, Director GM Department.""",,David Goldman,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/business/gm-oshawa-plant/index.html,0,1543190400000,0,1,18,763,0,1,2,-0.6,0.10020702151383971,0.0,0
Manchester United players earning half a million more than Manchester City rivals,"United players are also picking up almost double what Tottenham are paying their first-team squad.

Meanwhile, Barcelona have become the first sports team to pay an average yearly salary of more than 10m.

Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester United are also in the top 10 spenders.

The other six clubs in the top 10 all come from the NBA.

Clubs in the Premier League are paying, on average, more than top-flight football clubs in any other country per game, although cricket's Indian Premier League and American football's NFL top the spending on a per-game basis.

Premier League big spenders
Manchester City may have won the Premier League last season, but they come in behind Manchester United this term on wages with the Old Trafford club paying an average of 6,534,654 per year to first-team players.

City's yearly bill comes in at 5,993,000, followed by Chelsea (5,020,004), Liverpool (4,862,963), Arsenal (4,853,130) and Tottenham (3,515,778).

Everton and West Ham follow closely behind Spurs, while Cardiff, Huddersfield and Burnley make up the bottom three - the Bluebirds are the only Premier League club to come in under 1m for the year.

That said, despite Burnley's average annual first-team wage of 1,603,197 placing them third-bottom of the Premier League pile, the Clarets are still paying more than the likes of Ligue 1's Monaco and Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.

""The two Manchester clubs, United and City, remain clear of the rest in basic pay terms according to our calculations,"" say Sporting Intelligence, who conduct the survey.

""We thought last year that whichever of the pair achieved the most on the pitch would end up with the larger of the two overall wage bills (all staff) for 2017-18.

""In fact City won the league and had wages of 260m and United faltered but paid out 296m.""

City finished as champions ahead of United, but while Pep Guardiola's side top the league again this campaign Jose Mourinho's outfit have slipped to seventh.

Sporting Intelligence says this was largely down to United's return to the Champions League, but do point out some of Manchester City's wage bill appears under the City Football Group.

Barcelona break the 10 million mark
Not only have Barcelona become the first sports club in the world to pay an average of more than 10m a year to first-team players, the Spanish giants have also broken the 200,000-per-week barrier for the first time.

On average, first-teamers at the Nou Camp earn 10,454,259 a year, which translates to an average 201,043 per week.

European champions and La Liga rivals Real Madrid are second on the list with a yearly average of 8,089,582, with Italian side Juventus the third-highest paying football club at 6,726,615 on average per year.

Despite Barca and Real's dominance on the pay scale, the average Premier League yearly salary remains 36% higher than that of La Liga and almost double the amount paid to players in Italy's Serie A.

Basketball's Oklahoma City Thunder are the highest-paying non-football club, closely followed by Golden State Warriors, while outside of football and basketball it is Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs who lead the way as the 30th highest-paying sports team.

IPL and NFL paying most per game
Virat Kohli
Royal Challengers Bangalore paid 2m to retain India captain Virat Kohli in January
With just 14 games per season, the IPL tops the charts for the average pay per player, per game at 274,624, while the NFL comes in at 138,354 over 16 games.

In comparison, Premier League teams are paying their players an average of 78,703 per match during a 38-game season.

""Two notable things happened with IPL wages in 2018: they got bigger, and the outlay by different teams got closer together,"" says Sporting Intelligence.

""A new five-year TV rights deal, concluded last year for 1.96bn for 2018-2022, has come on stream. That guarantees the medium-term future of an event that has often struggled for certainty.

""Uniquely, IPL salaries are pro-rated from weekly pay to annual pay because, again uniquely, IPL players typically have multiple different professional employers concurrently.

""The vast majority of other teams in other leagues contract their players for at least a year at a time. You simply don't get NFL stars playing a season in the USA then another in Germany in the same year; or a Premier League player appearing freelance for six different teams in a campaign.""",,,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46341672,0,1543190400000,0,1,12,730,0,0,0,0.16666666666666669,0.043203135248589826,0.0,0
Holocaust Survivors Recall Exact Day Holocaust Started Right Out Of The Blue,"NEW YORKRemembering the mixture of fear and surprise they felt during the dark time in their past, a group of Holocaust survivors recalled the exact day that the Holocaust started right out of the blue, sources confirmed Tuesday. Youd think there wouldve been some warning signs, but nopeeverything was going along just fine until the Holocaust just up and started out of nowhere, said Esther Herzfeld, 94, who added how scared and baffled she was when she and her family had to go abruptly into hiding after hearing that Jewish people were being rounded up by something called the Gestapo. We were just minding our own business and everything was totally normal, with no curfew or persecutions or any limits on our rights, and all of a sudden, poofthe Holocaust was in full swing. No one could figure out how the Nazis randomly decided to go after Jews and the disabled and Roma and gay people, but by nightfall people were being grabbed off the street and sent to concentration camps, which had all been built over the previous 24 hours. It was crazyno one had any clue anything bad was going to happen. The nations Holocaust survivors also reportedly recalled that the suddenness of the Holocaust starting was probably why it took so long for anyone to come help them.",,,https://www.theonion.com/holocaust-survivors-recall-exact-day-holocaust-started-1830685498,2,1543276800000,1,1,12,221,0,0,0,0.17857142857142858,0.041130694702123285,0.0,0.07323404109118396
The State has turned off all of our water including our wells!,"We are not happy about this at all. Four years ago they started turning off our surface water. Two years ago they turned off our house water from a spring and now they are trying to turn off our irrigation wells. On the wells, they are going to have a fight (legal). The details of that will be skipped as that battle has just started.

What is more important is how blatant the Oregon Department of Water Resources Staff is about this. There was a meeting last Monday, where they were happy to explain how their computer model tells them that 140 wells that are closer than 1 mile to a river are denying the rivers over 100 cubic feet per second(cfs), but the wells that are one foot over a mile from the river are not hurting the river enough to bother. That right there should tell you there is a problem with what they are doing.

I assert the model has no correlation to the real world. How can I back that up you ask?

I can back that up several ways. The easiest way is looking at the river flow. There is a gauge station on the Lower Williamson River that has been there for 100 years. For those paying attention 100 years of data is a lot of data. Most of the irrigation wells have been drilled since 1950. That means we have river data for 32 years before the wells were drilled. In those 32 years the  average flow is 860cfs. Since 1951 the average flow is 1052cfs. That means since the wells have been drilled there is almost another 200 cfs in the rivers.

That does not sound like the wells are drying up the rivers. In fact, a person could argue that the wells are helping the river flows in a number of ways.",,Brandan  Topham,http://farmwars.info/,0,1526169600000,1,1,12,311,0,0,0,0.0,0.08739495798319329,0.0,0.02913165266106443
Bill Gates has paid more Taxes than anyone in the History of the World!!!,"Technology innovator and billionaire Bill Gates has paid more taxes than anyone in the history of the world, and he says he is happy to pay even more. The co-founder of Microsoft is currently worth an estimated US $91.8 billion and has paid a total of over US $10 billion in taxes to the US government. Speaking to CNNs Fareed Zakaria, the Microsoft billionaire revealed the staggering amount he pays in taxes.


 
I have paid more taxes, over US $10 billion, than anyone else, but the government should require people in my position to pay significantly higher taxes, he said.

Bill Gates spoke about the need for the US government to increase the estate tax, which favours the super rich as the wealth they leave behind is taxed at a very low percentage at the current tax rate.


 
The billionaire and philanthropist has called upon other rich Americans and people around the world to join his giving pledge in which they will leave a big chunk of their wealth to charity. Among the billionaires who have signed Bill Gates pledge are Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and veteran billionaire investor Warren Buffet.

"Hyde-Smith defeats Espy in Mississippi special election runoff, expanding GOP Senate majority","Republicans on Tuesday expanded their incoming Senate majority to 53 seats, as incumbent Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith handily beat back an insurgent challenge by Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi's special election runoff to become the first woman ever elected to Congress from the state.

With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Hyde-Smith had 446,927 votes to Espy's 374,880 -- a commanding margin of 54.4 percent to 45.6 percent, according to state election officials. The race marks the final midterm contest of 2018.

I want everybody to know, no matter who you voted for today, Im gonna always represent every Mississippian, Hyde-Smith said at her victory party late Monday night.  ""Being on that MAGA-wagon, the Make American Great Again bus, we have bonded, we have persevered, we have gotten through things, we were successful today.""

Hyde-Smith, 59, is an ardent supporter of President Trump who was appointed earlier this year by Mississippi's governor to fill retiring Sen. Thad Cochran's seat. She will finish out the remaining two years of Cochran's term in the deep-red state that went for President Trump by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.

Hyde-Smith's win gives Republicans more leeway to ensure the confirmation of Trump's federal judicial and Cabinet nominees that require Senate approval, and strengthens the party's chances of holding the majority in 2020.

""She has my prayers as she goes to Washington to unite a very divided Mississippi,"" Espy said in his concession speech.

Cindy Hyde-Smith has been a strong conservative voice since joining the Senate, so it should come as no surprise that she was elected by Mississippians to represent them in Washington, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Cory Gardner said in a statement. Senator Hyde-Smith won tonight because she has a trusted record of fighting for Mississippi, and we are happy she will be returning to the United States Senate.

On Nov. 6, Hyde-Smith prevailed in a four-way race that included firebrand Republican Sen. Chris McDaniel -- but she was unable to secure more than 50 percent of the vote amid heavy turnout, owing to McDaniel's strong showing. The Nov. 6 election -- which saw nearly half of registered voters in Mississippi cast ballots in the Senate race-- triggered Tuesday's runoff.

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith's Republican Senate colleagues are standing up for her in her runoff race against Democrat Mike Espy; Peter Doocy reports from Jackson, Mississippi.

McDaniel sharply criticized Hyde-Smith throughout the campaign for being insufficiently supportive of the president's agenda, and some analysts suggested he may have dampened enthusiasm among conservatives for her candidacy.

There has been a lot of work done to make sure that McDaniels supporters will turn out, but the hardest part about runoff elections is getting people to turn out, Jennifer Duffy, the senior editor for the Cook Political Report, told Fox News. If they dont turn out, McDaniel will be seen as the spoiler because if it wasnt for him, there would not have been a runoff in the first place.

AT ROUNDTABLE WITH HYDE-SMITH, TRUMP CRITICIZES 'GRABBER' MIGRANTS WHO USE KIDS AS HUMAN SHIELDS

McDaniel offered only a lukewarm endorsement for Hyde-Smith after his defeat earlier in the month, saying, ""I don't believe she's the conservative for this state."" He also told his supporters that ""President Trump wants us to unite, and we will unite"" to back her.

Espy cannot be allowed to win this seat, McDaniel said shortly after conceding the race, according to Mississippi Today. President Trump wants us to unite, and we will unite. We will back Cindy Hyde-Smith.

The 64-year-old Espy, who was vying to become Mississippi's first black senator since Reconstruction, had previously served in Congress and in former President Bill Clinton's administration.

Mississippi last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1982, but Espy was trying for the same kind of longshot win that fellow Democrat Doug Jones had nearly a year ago in neighboring Alabama, another conservative Deep South state where Republicans hold most statewide offices.

His campaign gained a second wind amid a flurry of damaging reports and missteps that inundated Hyde-Smith's campaign in recent days. Mississippi's past of racist violence became a dominant theme in the race after a video showed Hyde-Smith praising a supporter in early November by saying, ""If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row."" She said it was ""an exaggerated expression of regard.""

As voters headed to the polls, nooses were found outside Mississippi State Capitol, along with signs explaining that they were placed there by protesters who wanted to raise awareness about the state's history of racially motivated lynchings. Some media figures inaccurately blamed Hyde-Smith supporters for placing the nooses.

""So many things are taken out of context,"" said Elizabeth Gallinghouse, 84, from Diamondhead, Mississippi. ""The fact that she toured Jefferson Davis's house. You or I could have done the same thing. They said, 'Put this cap on. Hold this gun.' It was a fun time. She wasn't trying to send any messages.""

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL BECOMES LATEST BIG MONEY DONOR TO DEMAND MONEY BACK FROM HYDE-SMITH

More than a week after the video's release, Hyde-Smith apologized at a televised debate to ""anyone that was offended by my comments,"" but also said the remark was used as a ""weapon"" against her. Espy responded: ""I don't know what's in your heart, but I know what came out of your mouth.""

Some corporate donors, including Walmart and Major League Baseball, requested refunds on their campaign contributions to Hyde-Smith after the videos surfaced.

Hyde-Smith was seen in another video talking about making voting difficult for ""liberal folks,"" and a photo circulated showing her wearing a replica Confederate military hat during a 2014 visit to Beauvoir, a beachside museum in Biloxi, Mississippi, that was the last home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis.

Sen. Hyde-Smith's gaffes tighten Mississippi Senate raceVideo
Critics said Hyde-Smith's comments and Confederate regalia showed callous indifference in a state with a 38-percent black population, and some corporate donors, including Walmart, requested refunds on their campaign contributions to her.

However, Espy has had his own negative press in the run-up to the runoff. In particular, the Hyde-Smith campaign hammered Espy for his $750,000 lobbying contract in 2011 with the Cocoa and Coffee Board of the Ivory Coast. She noted that the country's ex-president, Laurent Gbagbo, is being tried in the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.

Espy, who is an attorney, said: ""I found out later that this guy, the president, was a really bad guy. I resigned the contract.""

""She stood up to the Democrat smear machine.""

 President Trump
Espy resigned as President Bill Clinton's agriculture secretary in 1994 amid a special-counsel investigation that accused him of improperly accepting gifts. He was tried and acquitted on 30 corruption charges, but the Mississippi Republican Party ran an ad this year that called Espy ""too corrupt for the Clintons"" and ""too liberal for Mississippi.""

Espy said he refused to accept offers of plea deals because, ""I was so not guilty, I was innocent.""

The significance of the race was not lost on President Trump or top Republicans, who headlined two major rallies Monday night for Hyde-Smith in Mississippi to boost turnout.

""If you like [Supreme Court Justice Brett] Kavanuagh, there's more coming,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told the crowd in Tupelo, Miss. ""Let's win tomorrow.""

""She stood up to the Democrat smear machine,"" Trump said, referring to Hyde-Smith's support for Kavanaugh amid a series of uncorroborated and lurid sexual misconduct allegations.

He added: ""Your vote on Tuesday will decide whether we build on our extraordinary achievements, or whether we empower the radical Democrats to obstruct our progress.""

Hyde-Smith, who has made the Trump rallies a highlight of her runoff campaign, told the crowd in Tupelo: ""I worked very, very hard for you. I have stood up for you and you know I will continue to stand up for the conservative values of Mississippi.""

INSANE: Migrant caravan shoved women and children to the FRONT so they would be photographed with tear gas then media blames Trump,"(Natural News) As the caravan migrant crisis festers along the U.S.-Mexico border, our Leftist establishment media continue to misrepresent what is actually occurring so they can lay the blame for it at the feet of POTUS Donald Trump.

Earlier this week the media, and like-minded talking heads on various cable news outlets, were outraged (again) over images showing women and children being gassed by U.S. Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection agents. 

As reported by The National Sentinel, what the media failed to report was why anyone was gassed: Male migrants became overly aggressive, stormed the border, and began pelting agents with rocks and bottles. San Diego Chief Border Patrol Agent Rodney Scott said that personnel did not use tear gas, pepper balls, and other dispersion techniques until after his agents were attacked. Several agents were actually struck by rocks, Scott said.

Regarding the images taken by the establishment media showing women and children caught up in the melee, they were physically placed in front by the attacking migrants. 

What we saw over and over yesterday was that the group  the caravan, as we call them  would push women and children to the front and then begin, basically, rocking our agents, Scott said.

They use women and children regularly, National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told The Daily Caller. 

Breitbart News confirmed this, publishing additional comments from Scott, who said he found it unconscionable that anyone would take children intentionally into this situation. (Related: Border Patrol chief says Army cant stop migrant invasion, only new laws and a wall can.)

Sponsored solution from the Health Ranger Store: Lab-verified Nascent Iodine solution is a dietary supplement that provides your body with supplemental iodine to help protect your thyroid during radiation exposure. Nuclear accidents such as Fukushima (or nuclear war) can expose your body to radioactive iodine-131, a dangerous radioisotope. Pre-loading your system with stable iodine occupies the iodine receptor sites on your organs, causing your body to naturally expel radioactive iodine you may have been exposed to through air, food, water or milk products. This defensive strategy is recommended by nearly all health authorities, worldwide, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Discover more at this link.

He also noted that agents do not and did not target any women and children with tear gas.

We try specifically to target the instigators, the person assaulting the agent. But as you saw, once that chemical is released, it does go through the air  I inhaled quite a bit of it yesterday, he said, adding:

We are in the process of building the new border wall here, but we dont have it completed. There were some sections that had the dilapidated border wall that was made out of scrap metal the military gave us.

The group breached a couple sections of that, actually tore down one small section, started to rush across. And thats another time that they started assaulting our agents. We were able to hold them back using riot-type, riot techniques. But there were, ultimately 42 arrests of individuals. And again, as I mentioned, the vast majority of those were adult males.

NOT the presidents fault
The vast majority of people comprising the caravans  a great many of whom appear to be military-aged males  are attempting to claim economic hardship as their impetus for wanting asylum in the U.S., Scott said.

But as Border Patrol Council spokesman Chris Cabrera told Fox News Laura Ingraham Monday night on her show, The Ingraham Angle, claiming to want a better life or a better job are not valid reasons for granting asylum.

They know theyre taking advantage of the system, and they know there is nothing we can do about it, he said, adding that the strategy of invading the U.S. border en masse is to gain access one way or another because thanks to existing law, anyone who enters  legally or otherwise  can claim asylum within a year.

He added that none of the chaos along the U.S.-Mexico border is POTUS Trumps fault, despite the medias best efforts to blame him.

The president cant be held responsible for this. Theres only so much he can do. He has called for an additional 5,000 border patrol agents, yet Congress has failed to act on that. If we had that, we wouldnt be in this situation where we needed the military to come in and help us, he said.

New Ebola Outbreak Reaches A Major City In Congo As The WHO Warns About The Possibility Of An Explosive Increase In Cases,"The worst Ebola outbreak in a number of years has health officials on high alert, and the fact that a case is now being reported in a major city is extremely concerning. As we have seen during past outbreaks, Ebola can spread very rapidly, and the mortality rate during an outbreak is often above 50 percent. A few years ago, just rumors that Ebola might start spreading inside the United States caused quite a bit of panic out there. Let us hope that this current outbreak is brought under control quickly, because Ebola is a horrible, horrible disease.

The reason why there is so much concern at the moment is because a brand new case of Ebola is being reported in a city of more than a million people. The following comes from NPR

A new case of Ebola has emerged in an urban area of Democratic Republic of the Congo, a troubling development in the countrys new outbreak of the contagious and often fatal virus. Until now, the outbreak had affected a rural area.

Dr. Oly Ilunga, Congos minister of health, announced Wednesday that a suspected case was confirmed in Mbandaka, a city of about 1.2 million people, and the capital of the quateur Province.

Ebola can spread much more rapidly in urban areas because people live so much closer together. Up until now, this latest outbreak has been confined to rural areas

WHO says 44 cases of Ebola have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  most in a remote, northwestern province that is very hard to reach. More than 20 people have died.

Global health officials are monitoring this outbreak very closely, and hopefully that will keep this outbreak confined. But it is important to note that one top WHO official is warning that we are now facing the possibility of an explosive increase in cases

This is a major development in the outbreak, said Peter Salama, the WHOs deputy director general of emergency preparedness and response. We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola. The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.

There is certainly no reason for anyone in the United States to panic at this point, but it is always a good idea to be prepared for any situation. The following are some thoughts from prepping expert Daisy Luther

At this point, we have no reason to be overly concerned if we are not in the DRC, however, it pays to be watchful and prepared. The last time around, it made it to the United States and it was nearly impossible to get supplies by the time it was diagnosed here.

From a preparedness point of view, if an outbreak occurs, social isolation is the number one way to prevent becoming ill. The death rate for someone who contracts Ebola is 50%. Ebola is the potential pandemic that really keeps me up at night. Its scary stuff. This article explains how a localized outbreak can turn into a pandemic.

We will continue to monitor this outbreak, and we will bring you any important updates as they become available.

And I apologize for not writing very much so far in 2018. I put everything that I had into running for office, and now that campaign has ended. I will continue to endeavor to make a difference through my writing, and I want to thank all of my regular readers for the tremendous amount of patience that they have had with me in recent months.

Now I will be resuming a normal writing schedule, and we have some big things planned for the very near future.

Washington Post: Trump says his 'gut' can tell him more than 'anybody else's brain can ever tell me',"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump blamed the General Motors plant closures and recent stock market dips on the Federal Reserve and the man he picked to lead it, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.

""I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed,"" Trump told the Post in an interview. ""They're making a mistake because I have a gut and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.""
GM announced Monday that it will shut production at five plants in North America and reduce its salaried workforce by 15%, including a quarter of the company's executives.
The President told the Post that he is ""not even a little bit happy"" with Jerome Powell, the man he picked to head the Federal Reserve.
Trump has long expressed frustration with Powell. Leading up to the November midterm elections, Trump repeatedly bashed him and called the Fed ""crazy"" and ""loco"" over recent interest-rate increases. Since July, Trump's repeated scrutiny of Powell has gradually escalated with new veiled threats that he might consider firing his Fed chairman.
In the wide-ranging interview with the Post, Trump also dismissed the US government report released last week that delivered a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts.
Trump told the Post ""I don't see"" climate change as man-made, despite the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community that climate change is caused by human activity.
""One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers,"" Trump told the Post. ""You look at our air and our water, and it's right now at a record clean.""
The government report said the US economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars -- or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its gross domestic product -- by the end of the century.
Trump also threatened to cancel his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week after Russian ships opened fire on and seized three Ukrainian vessels near Crimea. The President is expected to meet with the foreign leader at a G20 meeting in Argentina, and is scheduled to discuss security and regional issues, Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Tuesday during the White House briefing.
Trump said he was waiting for the ""full report"" from his national security team, according to the Post, and said the report ""will be very determinative.""
""Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting. ... I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,"" Trump told the Post.

Remote Indian Tribe Kills American Missionary Trying To Force Christianity On Them,"Theyre the  sex-crazed tribe cut off from the world for 30,000 years and they dont like visitors  especially fanatical  holier-than-thou missionaries anxious to ram Christianity down their throats. They repel all visitors by shooting them with poison arrows. Their message is quite clear: This is our island, and we dont want any intruders, so KEEP AWAY! 

Poison arrows, knives, spears, clubs, axes, rocks  all of them have been waved very angrily. Over the years, the message from the natives of the tiny island of North Sentinel in the Bay of Bengal could not have been clearer. Keep away. Go home. Buzz off. Visitors not welcome. We want to be alone.

Of course they do.

The Sentinelese are one of a very few remaining uncontacted peoples in the world and they are determined to keep it that way. Which means we know tantalisingly little about their language, their culture, their belief system or even how many of them there are.

But what we do know is that they have lived happily and largely healthily on their tiny, lush, mangrove-swamped 20-square-mile island for at least 30,000 years.

During which time, they have feasted on wild pig, clams, berries and honey, engaged in energetic communal sex sessions on the beach and repelled pretty much every visitor (well-meaning or threatening) with a flurry of poison arrows and razor sharp machetes.

So it wasnt such a surprise last weekend when John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old American Christian missionary-cum-thrill-seeking explorer who visited the island was felled by a poison arrow and then dragged round the white sand beaches by a piece of twine until he was dead.

Apparently Chau, a graduate of the evangelical Oral Roberts University, Oklahoma, who had previously declared visiting North Sentinel as his must-do adventure, had decided his lifes calling was converting the Sentinelese to Christianity.

Poor well-intentioned Chau! Of course, his death is an utter tragedy  a young life cut off in such an horrific and courageous way. He continued walking into the arrows as they fired, so intent was he on delivering his message from God.

And from all accounts he was a wonderful human being  kind, big-hearted and wonderful fun.



JOHN CHAU, 26-YEAR-OLD CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY
killed last weekend by the natives of North Sentinel island
for visiting their remote island against their will.

LD: I disagree most emphatically with the politically correct writer of this article, Jane Fryer, that this reckless and stupid  26-year-old Chinese American missionary is some kind of heroic martyr whose death is an utter tragedy  a young life cut off in such an heroic and courageous way. His death may have been horrific but the word courageous is surely out of place and suggests we ought to sympathize with this foolish young religious nut trying to force his way into an isolated island community bearing unwanted gifts.

We now know from studying history that any nation imprudent enough to welcome Christian missionaries into their midst, whether in the far East or in the New World or the Antipodes, soon ended up colonized and exploited to the hilt by their benefactors.

It took the Chinese and Indians many centuries  to throw off the shackles of their Christian invaders, who used religion as a cunning tool to gain access to their countries. They then used their gunboats and superior weaponry to batten on the natives like parasites. Evicting the toxic Western squatters was not an easy task, and the loot spirited away in the process remains incalculable to this day.

We agree with the writer of this article, however,  as she continues: But he [John Chao] shouldnt have been there [in the first place]. Under Indian law, it is illegal for anyone to be within five nautical miles of the islands and, since last year, even filming the natives in the Andaman Islands  which include North Sentinel  has been illegal.



LD (continued) : North Sentinel island, which is part of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, is now under Indian jurisdiction. India has decided, correctly in my view, that the people of this remote island community are a rare protected species. And that nosey anthropologists, do-gooder missionaries, and other opportunistic intruders should have the decency to keep away when they are clearly not welcome.

As we all know now from the study of imperial history, its only one small step from seemingly innocent tape recorders and  cameras and nice Christian missionaries armed with New Testaments  to Coca Cola, McDonalds,  plastic-strewn beaches, high-rise casinos, cocaine snorters, call girls, and, last but not least  the final gift from the dark gods!  sex tourism laid on for plane loads of decadent deviants from the West. 

No thank you! says India.

In 1974, Western visitors to the island tried to seduce the natives by offering them silly gifts, which included, bizarrely, a miniature plastic car, a live pig, and a bunch of aluminium cooking pots. 

You cant make this up. [LD] 

JANE FRYER CONTINUES:

This [Indias hands off policy] is partly to protect visitors such as Chau from the natives deadly tendencies.

But more importantly, it is to ensure the continued survival of the worlds last pre-neolithic tribe. A people, so isolated, so apart from, so unexposed to modern life that they are unlikely to have any resistance common illnesses such as flu, measles or even a cold.

As Sophie Grig, a senior researcher with Survival International, put it: This is one of the most vulnerable tribes on the planet. He could be passing on diseases that could literally wipe them all out.

Which as well as being a disaster for them, would be an anthropological catastrophe. Because the Sentinelese are the only surviving direct descendants of the first humans in Asia. More than 75,000 years ago they made their way from Africa to the Middle East, Burma and India.

Eventually, they reached the Andaman Islands. Some moved on, but others stayed on North Sentinel, drawn by the lush mangrove jungles, perfect white sandy beaches and a natural bounty so rich and easy to plunder there was no need to cultivate the land. The men hunted turtle, pigs and fish with spears, bows and arrows tipped with bone and hardwood.

The women gathered tubers, coconuts berries and clams and caught fish in homemade nets. In the summer they collected honey, smearing their bodies with a special bee-repellent leaf paste. All went naked (but for a few leaves, fibre strings and ornaments) and lived in huts in small family-based groups.

And thats how they still live 30,000 years on, protected by the sea and their own latent aggression from modernisation, gadgets, plastic, stress and other humans.

The first documented contact with the tribe was made over 1,000 years ago by Chinese and Arabian explorers who were driven back with a barrage of arrows and described the natives as being three feet tall with human bodies and bird beaks. Pretty much every attempt to visit them since has ended in disaster.

When Marco Polo encountered the islands in the 13th century, he wrote: They are a most violent and cruel generation who seem to eat everybody they catch. And, in 1563, a sailor, Master Caesar Frederick, warned: If any ship, by ill fortune, stop at these islands, no one comes back alive.

So for a long time, even when the rest of the Andaman and nearby Nicobar islands were colonised by the British in 1850 and turned into a penal colony, the Sentinelese were left alone to hunt, eat and generally make merry in their fecund island paradise.

Until 1880, when a British colonial expedition led by Maurice Vidal Portman landed with a squad of armed police, kidnapped an entire family and whisked them off to Port Blair in the Andaman Islands. The adults died immediately and a red-faced Portman hastily returned the four children with gifts.

LD: Maurice Vidal Portman is probably Jewish, as his name would suggest. Most of the key officials in the Rothschild-backed East India Company were known to be Jewish. These included the British sephardic Jew, Elias David Sassoon, and his equally predatory colleague Silas Aaron Hardoon, his partner in the firm E.D. Sassoon & Co. The same Jewish merchants were also to be found in China, financing the Opium Wars and turning millions of the Chinese people into helpless opium addicts.

See my article China and the Jews. Scroll down to Part 2: Opium, Sex and Death. See also here and here (with 271 comments). [LD] 

For nearly a century after that, the islanders were left largely to their own devices.

Until, in 1970, a group of anthropologists approached the island, notebooks and cameras at the ready, and were peppered with arrows and then treated to an energetic beach sex show, described by one observer as a sort of community mating, a frenzied dance of desire.

Four years later, there was another invasion attempt  this time the visitors were laden with offerings of a miniature plastic car, a live pig and a selection of aluminium pots.

The response? Yet another volley of poison arrows.

Occasionally, instead of firing weapons, the men wave their penises very angrily and, on rare occasions, would accept the odd coconut before opening fire. But the message has never changed.

Please leave us alone. We dont want to be friends.

Their decision to resist contact with the outside world is an intelligent one. They are frequently referred to as Stone Age or primitive, but from the little the outside world has been allowed to learn, we know they are anything but.

Today there are just 100 groups of people scattered across the world  including the Yanomami in northern Brazil; the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode in Bolivia; and, until the last member died in 2011, the Andaman Islands Bo tribe  who know nothing of our world and do their utmost to keep theirs a mystery.

But however unwelcoming they are, visitors keep coming.

Chau sounds like a bright and lovely young man. He claimed to have been fascinated by the people of North Sentinel and had researched them. Of course he knew of the danger he faced, if not the danger from his germs to the islanders.

LD : The fact that Chau knew his germs could kill them, but still decided to convert them to Christianity before decimating them with disease, tells us everything we need to know about this narcissistic young do-gooder.  A bright and lovely young man?  Oh dear, the author of this article appears to possess the same moral values of the village idiot she praises!   How truly depressing.     

Chau wrote a letter to his parents before he left, saying: I think its worth it to declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed. Hed visited several times before the fateful trip last week  taking scissors, safety pins and a football as gifts. [!!!]

In return they rained arrows down on him and damaged his canoe.

I have been so nice to them, why are they so angry and aggressive? he asked in his diary.

The Indian government adopts what it calls a hands off, eyes on policy for the tribe, which means officials moor boats nearby, to check on welfare from a safe distance. While the seven fishermen who transported Chau and his canoe to within the exclusion zone  and watched while he was killed  have all been arrested, there is no question anyone on the island will be bothered by the authorities.

Lets hope other reckless souls learn from Chaus death. The survival of the islanders depends on it.",,,https://www.darkmoon.me/2018/remote-indian-tribe-kills-american-missionary-trying-to-force-christianity-on-them/,0,1543104000000,1,1,12,1948,0,0,0,-0.05,0.05425400213154021,0.0,0.034751334043846734
Manaforts Lawyer Said to Brief Trump Attorneys on What He Told Mueller,"WASHINGTON  A lawyer for Paul Manafort, the presidents onetime campaign chairman, repeatedly briefed President Trumps lawyers on his clients discussions with federal investigators after Mr. Manafort agreed to cooperate with the special counsel, according to one of Mr. Trumps lawyers and two other people familiar with the conversations.

The arrangement was highly unusual and inflamed tensions with the special counsels office when prosecutors discovered it after Mr. Manafort began cooperating two months ago, the people said. Some legal experts speculated that it was a bid by Mr. Manafort for a presidential pardon even as he worked with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in hopes of a lighter sentence.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the presidents personal lawyers, acknowledged the arrangement on Tuesday and defended it as a source of valuable insights into the special counsels inquiry and where it was headed. Such information could help shape a legal defense strategy, and it also appeared to give Mr. Trump and his legal advisers ammunition in their public relations campaign against Mr. Muellers office.

For example, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Manaforts lawyer Kevin M. Downing told him that prosecutors hammered away at whether the president knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting where Russians promised to deliver damaging information on Hillary Clinton to his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The president has long denied knowing about the meeting in advance. He wants Manafort to incriminate Trump, Mr. Giuliani declared of Mr. Mueller.

[Paul Manaforts life has followed a trajectory of greed, deception and ego.]

While Mr. Downings discussions with the presidents team violated no laws, they helped contribute to a deteriorating relationship between lawyers for Mr. Manafort and Mr. Muellers prosecutors, who accused Mr. Manafort of holding out on them despite his pledge to assist them in any matter they deemed relevant, according to the people. That conflict spilled into public view on Monday when the prosecutors took the rare step of declaring that Mr. Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to them about a variety of subjects.

Mr. Manaforts lawyers insisted that their client had been truthful but acknowledged that the two sides were at an impasse. Mr. Manafort will now face sentencing on two conspiracy charges and eight counts of financial fraud  crimes that could put him behind bars for at least 10 years.

Mr. Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Though it was unclear how frequently he spoke to Mr. Trumps lawyers or how much he revealed, his updates helped reassure Mr. Trumps legal team that Mr. Manafort had not implicated the president in any possible wrongdoing.

Mr. Giuliani, who has taken an aggressive posture against the Russia investigation since Mr. Trump hired him in April, seized on Mr. Downings information to unleash lines of attack onto the special counsel.

In asserting that investigators were unnecessarily targeting Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani accused the prosecutor overseeing the Manafort investigation, Andrew Weissmann, of keeping Mr. Manafort in solitary confinement simply in the hopes of forcing him to give false testimony about the president.

But detention officials decide whether inmates serve in solitary confinement, according to law enforcement officials, and allies of Mr. Manafort have said he is there for his own safety.

A spokesman for Mr. Muellers office declined to comment. Mr. Weissmann is a longtime senior Justice Department prosecutor who specializes in prosecuting financial crimes and turning defendants into cooperating witnesses. His aggressive nature has earned him two competing reputations: Prosecutors view him as a relentless investigator who has overseen some of the Justice Departments most complex investigations, but some defense lawyers say he is overly combative and will bend the facts to gain a conviction.

In his own recent Twitter attacks on the special counsel, the president seemed to imply that he had inside information about the prosecutors lines of inquiry and frustrations. Wait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie, Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday.

Earlier this month, he tweeted: The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want.

Mr. Manaforts legal team had long kept Mr. Trumps lawyers abreast of developments in his case under a joint defense agreement. The presidents team has pursued such pacts as a way to monitor the special counsels inquiry. Mr. Giuliani said last month that the presidents lawyers had agreements with lawyers for 32 witnesses or subjects of Mr. Muellers 18-month-old investigation.

Defense lawyers involved in investigations with multiple witnesses often form such alliances so they can share information without running afoul of attorney-client privilege rules. But when one defendant decides to cooperate with the government in a plea deal, that defense lawyer typically pulls out rather than antagonize the prosecutors who can influence the clients sentence. For instance, a lawyer for the presidents former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn withdrew last year from such an agreement with Mr. Trumps lawyers before Mr. Flynn pleaded  guilty to a felony offense and agreeing to help the special counsel.

Mr. Manaforts lawyers, on the other hand, maintained their joint defense agreement with the presidents legal team even after Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts in September and began answering questions in at least a dozen sessions with the special counsel.


How the Mueller Investigation Could Play Out for Trump
If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.

May 23, 2018
Even if the pact was mostly informal at that point, law enforcement experts said it was still highly unusual for Mr. Manaforts lawyers to keep up such contacts once their client had pledged to help the prosecutors in hope of a lighter punishment for his crimes.

Mr. Manafort must have wanted to keep a line open to the president in hope of a pardon, said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney who now teaches law at University of Michigan. Im not able to think of another reason, she said.

If Mr. Manafort wanted to stay on the prosecutors good side, it would make no sense for him to continue to share information with other subjects of the investigation, said Chuck Rosenberg, a former United States attorney and senior F.B.I. official. He added: He is either all in or all out with respect to cooperation. Typically, there is no middle ground.

In another development on Tuesday, Mr. Manafort categorically denied a report in The Guardian claiming that he met with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks, around the time he joined the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016. Mr. Muellers team has been investigating whether any associates of Mr. Trump conspired with Moscows operation to influence the presidential election with documents stolen from Democratic computers and distributed by WikiLeaks.

This story is totally false and deliberately libelous. I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him. I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks, either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter, Mr. Manafort said in a statement released by his spokesman. He said he was considering legal action against the newspaper. WikiLeaks said on Twitter that Mr. Assange planned to sue the newspaper for libel over the article, which The New York Times did not independently confirm.

Listen to The Daily: Whats Going On With Paul Manafort?
We look at several twists in the case of President Trumps former campaign chairman that raise fresh questions for the special counsel investigation.
Last year, a lawyer for Mr. Trump broached the idea of presidential pardons to lawyers for both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn as prosecutors were building cases against both men, according to people familiar with the conversations. The lawyer, John Dowd, who later resigned from the presidents team, denied ever raising the prospect of a pardon.

But later, Mr. Giuliani suggested that Mr. Manafort and others might be eligible for pardons after Mr. Muellers inquiry ends, and the prospect has continued to hover over Mr. Manaforts case. On Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said she had no knowledge of any conversations about a pardon for Mr. Manafort. A week ago, after months of negotiations, Mr. Trump provided written answers to some questions from Mr. Mueller.

Some defense lawyers have suggested that prosecutors deliberately fashioned Mr. Manaforts plea agreement to counter a possible pardon. In forcing Mr. Manafort to forfeit almost all of his wealth  including five homes, various bank accounts and an insurance policy  prosecutors specified that they could seize his assets under civil procedures without regard to the status of his criminal conviction.

Harry Litman, a University of California, San Diego, law professor and a former deputy assistant attorney general, said that he had seen similar provisions in other cases. But other legal experts said it seemed tailor-made to ensure Mr. Manafort would lose much of his wealth, no mat",,"Michael S.

Logan Paul Apologizes For Controversial Unboxing Video,"Los Angeles  The popular youtuber Logan Paul is in hot waters again, and had to issue another apology after a controversial unboxing video, The Hard Times reports.

Apparently, he opened up a casket in a local cemetery, in a video titled UNBOXING IN GRAVEYARD (SAVAGE).

The video was removed by Youtubes team around 2 hours after being uploaded, since it literally showed the Youtuber in Westwood Village Memorial Park in California, digging up a casket and opening it with his friends.

Woah check out this killer swag, said Paul, So, we got a dude inside who looks like he hasnt hit the gym in years. Whats up, bro? Whats with those skinny arms, bro?

Paul removed the body from the casket, lifted it and shouted Get it? DEAD-Lifting!, while playing Despacito.

Two hours later, he issued an apology on Twitter:

Lets start with this. Im sorry. Again. I never meant to offend anybody when I posted a video where I unbox a coffin, check out the cool collectibles inside, take out the corpse, and deadlift it. LOL! Sorry, just remembering that joke. Fuckin classic.

Donald Trump Promises To Stop The Crazy Muslims From North Korea,"Washington, D.C.  Within hours of North Koreas nuclear test Friday, it had become a political weapon in the U.S. The test  Pyongyangs fifth and most powerful  had enough force to rip the heart out of a city, one expert said. It marks one more step in North Koreas efforts to develop the missiles and miniaturized warheads needed to reach its perceived enemies. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seized on the test to discredit his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, arguing that its just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state.

The whole time that woman was secretary of state, she didnt do one good thing on the job, not a single one, Trump told CNN after a rally in Pensacola, Florida. And it ended with the catastrophic Benghazi scandal in 2012, where we lost an ambassador and several embassy personnel. And as if that wasnt enough, I read somewhere the other day that she doesnt feel that we lost anyone important in that bombing. Now, this is the Democratic presidential candidate were talking about here, I want you to understand that.


Asked how he would tackle the problem, the billionaire businessman promised he would stop those crazy Muslims from North Korea at all cost. Let tell you, Ive been in difficult situations all my life. Ive struggled, Ive been broke, Ive been booed thousands of times. Ive had my share of seemingly impossible situations and you want to know something? Im still standing and Im right here, and thats the kind of man America needs to help it become great again, he argued.

Those crazy North Korean Muslims think they can get away with threatening the world; well, theyve got another thing coming, Ill tell you that, he continued. You know how I got a reputation as a wall-builder because of my presidential campaign and plans to build a wall on the Mexico border? Well, it wasnt just for show. I am going to build a wall so great around all of North Korea that Kim Jong Un is going to have to push his engineers into creating an artificial sun just so hell be able to take a leak. And Im not going to stop at a giant wall; for North Korea, Im going all out with a ceiling, as well. Im going to turn that country into one giant tomb, so that if he ever decides to launch those missiles, the only thing hell be hitting is his own fat a*s.

This is just another proof that you just cant reason with Muslims, theyre not a reasonable people or religion. And the sanctions arent going to work, either. Theyll just start eating less than they already are and theyre going to get leaner and more difficult to kill if theres ever a war with them. No, those North Korean Muslims are a special breed. The only thing that would work against them is stripping them of their motivation to go on fighting. Going after their will to live is what well have to do if we want to beat them, and my wall with a hatch is going to deliver just that, unlike Hillary Clinton, who would only bend over for them, because, you know, thats about all women like her are ever good at, he concluded.",,Alex Stevan,https://politicot.com/donald-trump-promises-stop-crazy-muslims-north-korea/,0,1504396800000,1,1,11,554,0,0,0,-0.6,0.09589577089577091,0.0,0.23196525696525697

Trump appears consumed by Mueller investigation as details emerge,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's behavior isn't doing much to bolster White House assurances that he's got nothing to worry about from Robert Mueller's probe, after a series of potentially ominous turns in the Russia investigation.

The President's recent barrage of tweets and comments and testimony from sources close to him -- coinciding with thickening intrigue around the special counsel -- hint instead at deep concern on Trump's part.
""While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way, at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief. This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!"" Trump tweeted Wednesday, a day after blasting the special counsel as a ""conflicted prosecutor gone rogue.""
Despite this outburst of fury, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders painted a portrait of a President who was serenely awaiting Mueller's findings.
""I don't think the President has any concerns about the report because he knows that there was no wrongdoing by him and that there was no collusion,"" Sanders told reporters at her first daily briefing in a month.
The explanation for Trump's angst over his predicament seems to lie in a flurry of startling and potentially significant developments and reports swirling around his jailed ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and other associates.
Giuliani: Trump &#39;upset for weeks&#39; over Mueller squeezing Manafort

Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16
Trump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril.
He has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discrete public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself.
""The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,"" Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe.
Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN's Dana Bash the President had been ""upset for weeks"" about ""the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.""
Details emerge
Manafort denies ever meeting with Assange
Manafort denies ever meeting with Assange
While the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity.
In the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions.
The Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it ""totally false and deliberately libelous"" and Wikileaks was ""willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.""
The paper's sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions.
CNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between.
In another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter.
Such is the secrecy around Mueller's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice.
If there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election.
In his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort, for instance, Mueller's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied ""on a variety of subject matters"" -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge.
There was immediate speculation that Manafort's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller's progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger.
The New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort's lawyers.

Former Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary.
""What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?"" Ben-Veniste said.
It was not clear whether Manafort's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access.
Mueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia.

""A meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.
The House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump's presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power -- another possible reason for his mood.
In the long term, any sustained dip in Trump's popularity -- his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup's weekly tracking poll -- could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable.
Expectations high
The latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation.
Special counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort's alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks.
Mueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine.
So expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public
""Without releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,"" said Ben-Veniste.
Such a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump's acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker.
The new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President's current fury.
Trump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it's possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation.
